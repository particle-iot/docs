# Particle Debugging with Eclipse

*Debugging Particle Photon/P1/Electron code using JTAG/SWD and Eclipse*

This FAQ describes how to use Eclipse, a free IDE for Windows, Mac, and Linux, along with OpenOCD, to do source-level debugging of code running on a Particle Photon, P1, or Electron.

Some of the things you can do:

1. Set breakpoints in code and view source.
2. See the call stack.
3. View variables.
4. Single-step through code.

## Install local gcc-arm toolchain

- Install a gcc-arm toolchain for local building for Windows, Mac or Linux

The instructions are in the [local build FAQ](https://docs.particle.io/faq/particle-tools/local-build/). This is necessary because the cloud compilers are not configured to generate debugging builds.


## Connect the debugger device

In this tutorial, we'll use three different debugger devices, but they all work in the same way so you can choose whatever device you prefer.

Some debuggers support SWD (Single Wire Debug) mode, JTAG mode or both to talk to the STM32 microcontroller.

### Particle Programmer Shield

The [Particle Programmer Shield](https://store.particle.io/products/prog-shield) is designed to fit the Photon. You can also use it with an Electron, with the extra pins hanging over the edge. [It is available on the Particle store](https://store.particle.io/products/prog-shield).

If you need your device to be in a breadboard while you debug you can look at  using one of the other interfaces.

You will need to use two separate micro USB cables. One connects to the Programmer Shield to access the JTAG features, and the other connects directly to the Photon. 

The Photon USB cable isn't entirely necessary because the shield can power the Photon, but since the Eclipse debug process below by default uses DFU to load the debugging code onto the Photon, it's easier if you use a direct USB connection to the Photon for that.

![Particle Programmer Shield](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-progshield.jpg)

### Particle Programer Shield - Windows

In order to use a Particle Programmer Shield with OpenOCD under Windows you'll need to assign the **STM32 STLink** device using [Zadig](http://zadig.akeo.ie).

You may need to select **List All Devices** from the **Options** menu to see the device.

Select **USB <-> Serial Converter (Interface 0)** (USB ID 0403 6010 00). Then set the driver to **libusbK**. Make sure you select Interface 0, not Interface 1.

![Zadig settings for Particle Programmer Shield](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-programmer-zadig.png)


### Particle Programer Shield - Mac

This doesn't seem to be a problem with El Capitan and Sierra versions of Mac OS X, but you may encounter a driver conflict that makes it difficult to use the Programmer Shield on the Mac. The detailed instructions for the workaround are in the [instructions for the Programmer Shield](https://github.com/spark/shields/tree/master/photon-shields/programmer-shield).

In some cases, you may need to unload and reload the driver to get the Programmer Shield to work. This will need to be done after each reboot. Try it first without running this, as sometimes it works without it. It may be sufficient to only do this and not the more elaborate steps listed above, as well.

```
sudo kextunload -bundle com.apple.driver.AppleUSBFTDI 
sudo kextload -bundle com.apple.driver.AppleUSBFTDI
```

### Inexpensive mini SWD device

You can find inexpensive USB stick that support SWD (Serial Wire Debug) at places like Amazon and eBay for US&#36;12 or less. They work great with the Photon, P1, and Electron, requiring only two data lines and ground.

They are compatible with the official ST-LINK/V2, however these devices generally only support SWD. 

Here's an example on how to connect one brand of such an interface; verify that yours is the same before wiring.

- USB connector side away from you
- Debug header facing you
- Chips on top

||||||
| :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-: |
| VCC | SWIM | GND | RESET | Top Row (SWIM) |
| VCC | SWCKD | GND | SWDIO | Bottom Row (SWD) |

You will only use the bottom row (SWD). The SWIM connections are for the STM8 processors, not the STM32 processors used in the Particle devices.

In this picture, it's wired as follows. Note that the color code is not official, it's just what it happened to be with the female-to-male jumper wires that I used.

| SWD | Color | Photon Pin |
| :-:|:-:|:-: |
| VCC | Orange | No Connection |
| SWCKD | Yellow | D6 |
| GND | Green | GND | 
| SWDIO | Blue | D7 |

![Mini SWD device](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-stmini.jpg)

It's a little unclear whether the VCC pin (orange) should be connected for the mini devices. I generally leave it unconnected for the mini devices but connected for the actual ST-LINK/V2 real device.


### Mini SWD device - Windows

In order to use a mini SWD device with OpenOCD under Windows you'll need to assign the **STM32 STLink** device using [Zadig](http://zadig.akeo.ie).

You may need to select **List All Devices** from the **Options** menu to see the STLink device.

Select **STM32 STLink** (USB ID 0483 3748). Then set the driver to **libusbK**.

![Setting libusbk driver for STM32 STLink device](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-stlink-zadig.png)



### ST-LINK/V2 USB JTAG device

You can also use an [official ST-LINK/V2 device](http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/st-link-v2.html). It supports both JTAG and SWD mode.

If you have a full 20-pin JTAG connector (0.1"x0.1" pitch, in 2x10 layout) on your board, that's the easiest way to connect the device. The connector is keyed so you can usually only insert it one way.

You can also connect the ST-LINK/V2 using jumper wires; this is more practical for SWD as it only requires 3 or 4 pins. 

| Pin | Function | JTAG | JTAG Pin | SWD | SWD Pin |
| :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-: |
| 1 | VAPP | MCU VDD | 3V3 | MCU VDD | 3V3 |
| 2 | VAPP | MCU VDD | - | MCU VDD | - |
| 3 | TRST | TRSTN | D3 | GND | - |
| 4 | GND | GND | GND | GND | GND |
| 5 | TDU | JTDI| D5 | GND | - |
| 6 | GND | GND | - | GND | - |
| 7 | TMS_SWDIO | JTMS | D7 | SWDIO | D7 |
| 8 | GND | GND | - | GND | - |
| 9 | TCK_SWCLK | JTCK | D6 | SWCLK | D6 |
| 10 | GND | GND | - | GND | - |
| 11 | NC | NC | - | NC | - |
| 12 | GND | GND | - | GND | - |
| 13 | TDO_SWO | JTDO | D4 | TRACESWO | - |
| 14 | GND | GND | - | GND | - |
| 15 | NRST | NRST |  - | NRST | - |
| 16 | GND | GND | - | GND | - |
| 17 | NC | NC | - | NC | - |
| 18 | GND | GND | - | GND | - |
| 19 | VDD | NC | - | NC | - |
| 20 | GND | GND | - | GND | - |

You only need to connect one GND line, though it's best to connect all of them if possible to reduce noise on the ribbon cable if you are making a board with a 20-pin JTAG connector.

If you're just using SWD like you would with the mini SWD device, you should connect it as follows:

The pins on the connector are numbered this way when you have the programmer positioned so the logo is upright and the notch is on the bottom of the 20-pin connector.

|||||||||||
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 | 14 | 16 | 18 | 20 |
| 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9  | 11 | 13 | 15 | 17 | 19 |
| | | | | notch | | | | | 
 
As above, the color code is not official, it's just what I happened to have on the female-to-male jumper wires that I used.

| ST-LINK | SWD | Color | Pin |
| :-:|:-:|:-:|:-: |
| 1 | VCC | Orange | 3V3 |
| 4 | GND | Green | GND | 
| 7 | SWCKD | Yellow | D6 |
| 9 | SWDIO | Blue | D7 |


![ST-LINK/V2](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-stlink.jpg)

## Building Debug Builds

**Important: Make sure your software doesn't use the debugger pins: D6 and D7 for SWD, or D4, D5, D6, and D7 for JTAG.** This means you can't use the D7 user LED while using the debugger.

The firmware compiled through the Web IDE, Desktop IDE or CLI are don't contain debug information.  You'll need a local gcc-arm toolchain to make builds that are compatible with the debugger.

For debugging using JTAG/SWD you create special monolithic debug builds. They're monolithic in that they are a single file that contains the system and user firmware instead of the usual modular binaries (system parts and user part). The disadvantage of the monolithic binaries is that they are large, maybe 480 Kbytes for a simple program that might only be 6 Kbytes normally!

Whenever you switch between debug and non-debug builds, or monolithic to non-monolithic, you must add the clean option to make.

In this example I created a new  directory in src called "tinkerbreak" that contains [tinkerbreak.cpp](/assets/files/eclipse-debug/tinkerbreak.cpp), a modified version of tinker that responds to the Particle function "break" to break into the debugger under software control.

![src directory layout](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-srcdir.png)


To build manually (not using Eclipse), you'd use a command line like this, based on the directory layout in the gcc-arm installation instructions linked to above.

```
cd firmware/main
make clean all program-dfu PLATFORM=photon MODULAR=n DEBUG_BUILD=y USE_SWD_JTAG=y APPDIR=../../tinkerbreak
```

In the tinkerbreak/target directory are a few files that you may need:

- tinkerbreak.bin - monolithic firmware build (can flash with the Particle CLI or dfu-util)
- tinkerbreak.elf - The debugging binary needed by gdb


### Restoring modular firmware

To restore normal modular firmware, to allow for user flashing independent of system firmware and normal OTA flashing, put the device in DFU mode and:

```
particle flash --usb tinker
```

After it reboots, immediately put it back in DFU mode, then:

```
particle update
```


## Eclipse Install

This is the abbreviated method that will allow you to use the source debugger in Eclipse. Setting up a project that has full code analysis and auto-completion is much more complicated, and will be the topic of a separate FAQ. For this version, we just turn off displaying some errors.

### Eclipse Base Install - Windows


- Install Java 8 JDK (if necessary)

You may need to install a modern Java 8 JDK (not just the JRE) in order to use Eclipse. The [JDK install page](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html#javasejdk) has a link to download the JDK, which is what you need. 

Select a download from the first group, Java SE Development Kit 8u*some number*. It was 8u111 when I wrote this, but select the current version.

I used the 64-bit Windows version, jdk-8u111-windows-x64.exe. You should use the latest version of JDK 8 for your operating system, not specifically build 111.

- [Download Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/) 

For this example, I selected **Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers** but you can choose a different one if desired. If you already have Eclipse installed, you can also just add in the packages to your existing install. The examples here use Eclipse Neon (4.6).

- Install Eclipse

The download is a zip file, not an installer. Select the file in your Downloads folder and right-click. Select **Extract All**. You will probably want to change the destination directory. I put mine in **C:\Program Files**. It will create the **eclipse** directory in that for you.

![Extract All](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-eclipse-extract-win.png)

- Create desktop shortcut (optional)

For convenience, I created a desktop shortcut icon as well. Right click on **eclipse.exe** and select **Create Shortcut** and select **Yes** to create it on the desktop (or drag and drop it there).

Now you should be able to launch Eclipse and complete the next step of the instructions, [Eclipse Install GNU ARM C/C++](#eclipse-install-gnu-arm-c-c-), which is common for all operating systems.

### Eclipse Base Install - Mac

- [Download Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/) 

For this example, I selected **Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers** but you can choose a different one if desired. If you already have Eclipse installed, you can also just add in the packages to your existing install. The examples here use Eclipse Neon (4.6).

- Drag the Eclipse file to your Applications folder. 

Eclipse doesn't have an installer or dmg file.

Also, you may be prompted to install the Legacy Java SE 6 for OS X when you first run Eclipse. If this happens, just follow the instructions for doing so.

- Upgrade to Java JDK 8 if necessary

However, if you install the Legacy Java SE 6, you will also need to install a more modern version of Java as well. You need to install the JDK, not the JRE, in order to use Eclipse. The [JDK install page](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html#javasejdk) has a link to download the JDK, which is what you need. 

- Select a download from the first group, Java SE Development Kit 8u*some number*. 

It was 8u111 when I wrote this, but select the current version.

I used the 64-bit Mac version, jdk-8u111-macosx-x64.dmg. You should use the latest version of JDK 8 for your operating system, not specifically build 111.

- Swap the default Mac OS X JVM

Then you need to swap version 8 for the version 6 of the Mac system JVM. Open a Terminal window:

```
os-x-10:~ rickk$ cd /Library/Java
os-x-10:Java rickk$ ls JavaVirtualMachines/
1.6.0.jdk		jdk1.8.0_111.jdk
os-x-10:Java rickk$ sudo mv Home Home6
os-x-10:Java rickk$ sudo ln -s JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_111.jdk Home
os-x-10:Java rickk$ ls -l
total 16
drwxrwxr-x  2 root  wheel   68 Dec  1 08:06 Extensions
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   36 Dec  1 08:19 Home -> JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_111.jdk
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   48 Dec  1 08:06 Home6 -> /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home
drwxr-xr-x  4 root  wheel  136 Dec  1 08:18 JavaVirtualMachines
```

Make sure you link to the version of the JDK you installed, which might not be build 111.

Now you should be able to launch Eclipse and complete the next step of the instructions, [Eclipse Install GNU ARM C/C++](#eclipse-install-gnu-arm-c-c-), which is common for all operating systems.



### Eclipse Base Install - Linux

While you can install Eclipse using apt-get, at the time of writing it was an old version, and all of the other platforms I'm using Eclipse Neon, so I opted for a manual install.

- You may need to install a modern Java 8 JDK (not just the JRE) in order to use Eclipse. 

The [JDK install page](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html#javasejdk) has a link to download the JDK, which is what you need. You can also use OpenJDK if you prefer.

- Select a download from the first group, Java SE Development Kit 8u*some number*. 

It was 8u111 when I wrote this, but select the current version.

I selected the Linux x64 tar.gz version, jdk-8u111-linux-x64.tar.gz. You should use the latest version of JDK 8 for your operating system, not specifically build 111.

- Extract the archive and move it to a suitable location. 

I selected /usr/local/jdk1.8.0_111.

```
rickk@ubuntu:~/Downloads$ tar xzf jdk-8u111-linux-x64.tar.gz
rickk@ubuntu:~/Downloads$ sudo mv jdk1.8.0_111 /usr/local/jdk8
```

- Add this to ~/.profile:

```
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk8
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
```

You'll probably have to log out and log back in after that.

- Check the Java version:

```
rickk@ubuntu:~$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_111"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_111-b14)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.111-b14, mixed mode)
```

- [Download Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/) 

For this example, I selected **Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers** but you can choose a different one if desired. If you already have Eclipse installed, you can also just add in the packages to your existing install. The examples here use Eclipse Neon (4.6).

I downloaded the Linux 64-bit version. 


- Install Eclipse

Extract the archive and move it to a suitable location:

```
rickk@ubuntu:~/Downloads$ tar xzf eclipse-cpp-neon-1a-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz 
rickk@ubuntu:~/Downloads$ sudo mv eclipse /usr/local/bin
```

- Create a desktop shortcut (optional):

```
rickk@ubuntu:~/Downloads$ cd ../Desktop/
rickk@ubuntu:~/Desktop$ ln -s /usr/local/bin/eclipse/eclipse .
```

Now you should be able to launch Eclipse and complete the next step of the instructions, [Eclipse Install GNU ARM C/C++](#eclipse-install-gnu-arm-c-c-), which is common for all operating systems.

### Eclipse Install GNU ARM C/C++

These steps are required for Windows, Mac and Linux to use the gcc-arm compiler and GDB with the Photon and Electron.

{{!-- NOTE: http://gnuarmeclipse.sourceforge.net/updates is currently broken so add steps on how to install manually --}}
{{!-- Remove this step when the update URL is fixed --}}
- Download [the latest release of the GNU ARM Eclipse plugin](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/releases).

- Run Eclipse 

- From the **Help** menu select **Install New Software...**

{{!-- Remove this step when the update URL is fixed --}}
- Click **Add** then **Achive** and select the zip file of GNU ARM Eclipse.
{{!-- Add these 2 steps when the update URL is fixed
- In the **Work with** box enter **http://gnuarmeclipse.sourceforge.net/updates** (1) and click **Add** (2).

![Add Software](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-eclipse-add-1.png)

- In the Add Repository window, enter **GNU ARM Eclipse** for the **Name** and click **OK**.

![Add Software](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-eclipse-add-2.png)

--}}
- Select the packages

![Add Software](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-eclipse-add-3.png)

You will need the following:

- GNU ARM C/C++ Cross Compiler
- GNU ARM C/C++ OpenOCD Debugging
- GNU ARM C/C++ STM32Fx Project Templates

If you're using a different debugging hardware like the Segger J-Link, be sure to select that as well. There are additional instructions at [the official download site](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/downloads/).

- Proceed through the rest of the installation steps

You may get a warning for unsigned content. You should select **OK** and proceed with the installation.

![Unsigned Content Warning](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-eclipse-add-4.png)



### Install GNU ARM Eclipse OpenOCD - Windows

There is a separate install for the operating system-specific GNU ARM Eclipse OpenOCD bits. 

[https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/openocd/releases](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/openocd/releases)

There are further installation instructions in the [GNU ARM Eclipse OpenOCD installation instructions](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/openocd/install/).

For Windows, just run the appropriate installer and accept all of the default options. The default install location is a little unwieldy but you can run the openocd --version command to test the new installation with a command something like this:

```
"C:\Program Files\GNU ARM Eclipse\OpenOCD\0.10.0-201610281609-dev\bin\openocd" --version

For bug reports, read
        http://openocd.org/doc/doxygen/bugs.html
```

Or better yet, the more involved example, using a ST-LINK/V2 mini SWD USB stick connected to a Photon **in DFU mode** (DFU has debugger support regardless of what firmware is flashed):

```
C:\Program Files\GNU ARM Eclipse\OpenOCD\0.10.0-201610281609-dev\scripts>..\bin\openocd.exe -f interface/stlink-v2.cfg -f target/stm32f2x.cfg

```

If you are using the Particle Programmer Shield, you will need to copy the configuration file. Download [particle-ftdi.cfg](/assets/files/eclipse-debug/particle-ftdi.cfg) and copy it into your OpenOCD installation directory, into **scripts/interface/ftdi/particle-ftdi.cfg**.



### Install GNU ARM Eclipse OpenOCD - Mac

There is a separate install for the operating-specific GNU ARM Eclipse OpenOCD bits. 

[https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/openocd/releases](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/openocd/releases)

There are further installation instructions in the [GNU ARM Eclipse OpenOCD installation instructions](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/openocd/install/).

For Mac, download the pkg installer and run it. You may need to go into **Control Panel** then **Security & Privacy** and use the **Open Anyway** button because of the unsigned content.

The installation directory will be something like: /Applications/GNU ARM Eclipse/OpenOCD/0.10.0-201610281609-dev. 

You can test it by connecting the debugging device to a Photon **in DFU mode** (DFU has debugger support regardless of what firmware is flashed). In this case, I connected a ST-LINK/V2 mini device to a Photon with SWD:

```

There are further installation instructions in the [GNU ARM Eclipse OpenOCD installation instructions](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/openocd/install/).

I downloaded the Debian 64-bit version, gnuarmeclipse-openocd-debian64-0.10.0-201610281609-dev.tgz but you should download whatever the current version is, along with 32-bit or 64-bit as appropriate.

Extract the archive and move it to a suitable location. 

```
rickk@ubuntu:~$ sudo mkdir /opt/gnuarmeclipse
rickk@ubuntu:~$ cd /opt/gnuarmeclipse/

## Create an Eclipse project - All Operating Systems

- From the **File** menu select **New** then **Makefile Project with Existing Code**.

![Eclipse New Project](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-eclipse-new-project-1.png)

In this example, we'll create a project for the tinkerbreak code we used in the command line example. Select that and make sure **Cross ARM GCC** is selected.

![Eclipse New Project](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-eclipse-new-project-2.png)

- Download [Makefile](/assets/files/eclipse-debug/Makefile) and save it into your project directory. 

It will be the same for all projects. You will need to right click on the project name (tinkerbreak) in the **Project Explorer** and select **Refresh** for it to display in Eclipse.

```

There must be a single tab before each of the two indented **cd** commands. The make will fail if there are spaces, which may happen if you copy and paste from the web page.

- Right click on **tinkerbreak** in the **Project Explorer** and select **Properties**. Most of the settings that you need to modify are located here.

![Project Properties](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-settings-2.png)

- Select **C/C++ Build**.

You should not need to change any setting on this page, but here's what it should look like:

![Project Properties](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-settings-3.png)

- Select **Build Variables** (1) in the **C/C++ Build** preferences.
- Use the **Add** button (2) to add two new build variables:

| Name | Type | Value |
| :-:|:-:|:-:|:-: |
| cross_make | String | make |
| cross_prefix | String | arm-none-eabi- |

It should look like this when done:

![Project Properties](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-settings-4.png)

After making a change in the preferences, it's a good idea to click **Apply** (3) to make sure the changes are saved.

- Select **Environment** (1) in the **C/C++ Build** preferences.


- For Windows: Use the **Add** button (2) to add new environment variables:

![Environment Properties Linux](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-settings-6.png)

APPDIR is the path to your source directory, the one you previously created a Makefile in. For Windows, make sure you use forward slashes (/) as the directory separator, not backward slashes commonly used in Windows. The reason is that the path is passed to GNU make, which handles the directory separators in a more Unix-like manner.

FIRMWARE is the path to the firmware release you downloaded earlier as part of the installation of the local gcc-arm build chain. For Windows, make sure you use forward slashes (/) as the directory separator.

MAKEOPTS are the options passed to make. When using the debugger with a monolithic debugging build, you typically use:

```
MODULAR=n DEBUG_BUILD=y USE_SWD_JTAG=y program-dfu
```

For the simplest non-debug modular build, the MAKEOPTS can be an empty string.

PATH specifies the PATH to pass to the shell running the Make. This may vary from computer to computer and operating system. 

For Windows, insert at the beginning, **C:/cygwin64/bin;C:/cygwin64/usr/local/bin** or where you have your Cygwin directory. This is necessary because Cygwin tools are not added to the Windows System PATH because they can cause odd problems when Linux-style tools conflict with DOS-style tools (like find), but Eclipse needs to be able to call tools like make.

For Linux and Mac, you should make sure that the gcc-arm local build chain is in the path. For example, **/usr/local/bin/gcc-arm/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin**.

PLATFORM is the platform you're building for, typically photon, p1, or electron.

TARGETBIN is the relative path to the built firmware binary. Setting it to:

```
target/${ProjName}.bin 
```

will automatically change it to match your project name. In this example, it would be target/tinkerbreak.bin.

- Click **Apply** (3) when done.


- Change error settings

This is necessary because the system firmware is not fully integrated into Eclipse in this FAQ, so the lack of definitions causes many lines to be flagged as errors.

Select **C/C++ General** then **Code Analysis** (1). Select **Use project settings** (2). Scroll down and uncheck the box for **Syntax and Semantic Errors** (3).

![Error Configuration](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-code-analysis.png)

Click **Apply** then **OK** to close the Properties window.

- Put the Photon in DFU mode (blinking yellow)
- Try a build. Right click on the project name (1) and select **Build Project** (2).

![Build Project](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-make-1.png)

After successfully building and flashing, you'll see a message in the **CDT Build Console** pane at the bottom of the window.

![Successful Make](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-make-2.png)

Some errors are pretty self-explanatory:

```
No DFU capable USB device available
make[1]: *** [../build/module.mk:113: program-dfu] Error 74
make: *** [Makefile:16: target/tinkerbreak.bin] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory '/cygdrive/c/Users/IEUser/Documents/src/firmware/main'
```

The firmware binary (target/tinkerbreak.bin) in this case will still be fine, but the Photon won't have that firmware automatically loaded on it, of course. If you don't want to flash the device automatically, remove the `program-dfu` option from **C/C++ Build** then **Environment** in the variable **MAKEOPTS**.


### Set up OpenOCD Debugging

From the **Run** menu select **Debug Configurations**. 

![Debug Configuration](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-debug-1.png)

If the **Run** menu is nearly empty, from the **Window** menu select **Perspective** then **Open Perspective** then **C/C++** and the **Debug Configurations** menu should appear.

Select **GDB OpenOCD Debugging** and click the **New** button.

![New Debug Configuration](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-debug-2.png)

In the **Main** tab, in the **C/C++ Application:** box, enter:

```
target/tinkerbreak.elf
```

If you've named your project differently, the pattern is still target/*project_name*.elf.

![Debug Main Configuration](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-debug-3.png)

In the **Debugger** tab, in the **Config options** enter:

```
-f interface/stlink-v2.cfg -f target/stm32f2x.cfg
```

If you're using a different debugger, specify that interface instead. For the Particle Programmer Shield, enter:

```
-f interface/ftdi/particle-ftdi.cfg -f target/stm32f2x.cfg
```

Then click **Debug**.

![Debug Target Configuration](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-debug-4.png)

You only need to set the Debug configuration once; the next time you want to run using the debugger, from the **Run** menu select **Debug History** then **tinkerbreak Default**. 

Make sure you select the *project name* **Default** option; selecting *project name*.elf will try (and fail) to launch the local debugger, not the SWD debugger. Likewise, clicking on the debug toolbar icon may try to launch the local debugger, as well.

![Debug History](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-debug-6.png)

- Click **Yes** to switch to a Debug perspective.

![Debug History](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-debug-8.png)

You should see a screen similar to the one below after a few seconds. A ST-LINK/V2 Mini SWD stick should be alternating red and green, and the Photon will probably have a solid white status LED. 

Of importance is that the execution is stopped at 0x0 (1) and you need to click the **Resume** button (2) to continue.

![Debug View](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-debug-7.png)

This is what the screen looks like when firmware is running. The Photon should be breathing cyan and the a ST-LINK/V2 Mini SWD stick should be still be alternating red and green.

![Debug View](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-debug-9.png)

If you see errors in the debugging console like these make sure your code is not using pins D6 and D7 (SWD), or D4, D5, D6 and D7 (JTAG).

```

Some more techniques are described below in the **Debugging Examples** section.

### Viewing the various consoles

Eclipse keeps multiple console views, one for each process. So there's one for the build, one for running openocd, one for running gdb, and so on.

![Debug Consoles](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-debug-5.png)


### Changing the gcc optimization level

By default, the standard Makefile optimizes for size, which makes complete sense. When debugging code, however, this can be annoying because it will make it impossible to set breakpoints at certain locations in the code, you won't be able to step some individual lines of code, and some variables won't be able to be inspected by the debugger.

- Edit firmware/build/arm-tools.mk

The file typically will have something like this near the top:

```
CFLAGS +=  -g3 -gdwarf-2 -Os -mcpu=cortex-m3 -mthumb
```

Simply remove the -Os (optimize for size). This is probably best done only for monolithic debug builds, since you may run out of space for some system parts in a modular build without optimization.

## Debugging Examples

Assuming you've set things up as described above, the tinkerbreak application will respond to a Particle function break. In a separate command prompt window, run a command like this, replacing test4 with the name or device ID of your Photon.

```
particle call test4 break
```

The screen will change to show the call stack (1) and the line where the breakpoint occurred (2).

![Debug Break](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-debug-10.png)

You can click the **Resume** button (3) to continue executing code on the Photon. It should reconnect to the cloud and resume breathing cyan.


### Setting breakpoints

To set a breakpoint in the code, double-click in the blue bar to the left of the line number. A small icon with a checkmark and a tiny blue circle will appear.

In this example, I set a breakpoint on line 51.

![Setting breakpoint](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-debug-11.png)

Then, in a separate command prompt window, issue a command like:

```
particle call test4 div 100
```

The Eclipse window should change to something like the following. 

Execution is suspended because of a breakpoint at line 51 (1).

The code at that line is highlighted (2).

The value of **div** is 100. The value of **result** is random because it hasn't been set yet.

Finally, click the **Step Over** toolbar icon (4) to proceed to to the next line of code.

![Hit breakpoint](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-debug-12.png)

Now you can see that that the next line of code is selected (1) and the value of **result** has been set appropriately (2).

Click the **Resume** button (3) to continue execution.

![Hit breakpoint](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-debug-13.png)

### Returning to C/C++ Perspective

To switch between the Debug and C/C++ Perspective, use the perspective icons in the toolbar in the upper right corner of the screen.

![Perspective Selector](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-debug-14.png)

### Switching between platforms

To switch between Photon and Electron, for example, right click on the project name, select **Properties** then **C/C++ Build** then **Environment** and edit the **PLATFORM** setting. In this case, I changed it to **electron**.

![Electron platform](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-settings-8.png)

You should always delete the **target** directory as well to make sure all of the necessary files are rebuilt. It's not necessary to do a **Clean**, which takes a very long time to run, as long as you delete the target directory.

### Debugging a P1 using SWD

If you've built a board with a P1, it's highly recommended that you include as many debugging ports as possible. However, as long as you include D6, D7, and GND for SWD, you can use OpenOCD and Eclipse for debugging.

- Right click on the project name, select **Properties** then **C/C++ Build** then **Environment** and edit the **PLATFORM** variable, setting it to **p1** (lowercase). Also remove **program-dfu** from the **MAKEOPTS** variable, as you can't use the program-dfu option if you don't have USB.

![Settings for P1](/assets/images/eclipse-debug-settings-9.png)

- Delete the **target** directory if you've changed the platform setting.

- Right click on the project name and select **Build Project**.

- Open two command prompt windows. In one, run the OpenOCD server in telnet mode. The directory may vary depending on version and operating system; other examples are shown above.

```
cd "/Applications/GNU ARM Eclipse/OpenOCD/0.10.0-201510281129-dev/scripts"
../bin/openocd -f interface/stlink-v2.cfg -f target/stm32f2x.cfg -c "telnet_port 4444"
```

- In the other, telnet to the OpenOCD server and issue command such as these to program the binary.

```
telnet localhost 4444
> reset halt
> flash protect 0 5 8 off
> program /Users/rickk/Documents/src/tinkerbreak/target/tinkerbreak.bin verify 0x08020000
```

- Close both windows to stop this instance of OpenOCD.

- From the **Run** menu in Eclipse, select **Debug History** then **tinkerbreak Default**. You should have a working debug session as above.
