## Wholesale Store Prerequisites

You will need several things to start placing orders on the Wholesale store: 
- **Particle Account** - You need a valid Particle account to be able to log in to the Wholesale store. 
- **Wholesale Account Approval** - Your account needs to be associated with a type of wholesale customer. See (Wholesale Account Creation)[TO DO] to get set up. If you have already received a Welcome email from us, you have a Wholesale account already.

Go to the [Wholesale store login page](https://login.particle.io/wholesale) to get started!

## Changing Business Information

After you sign in you will be directed to your account page. 

TO DO - RAGHU

This page should be populated with the information that you entered during sign up. Please review the information and correct any information that is not correct.

If the "Business Information" section is blank, that means Particle does not have your Tax ID/VAT Number and/or your Shipping Account Number. Please email orders@particle.io with the Subject line : "Wholesale Store Business Information". If this section does not apply to you you can skip this section.

Lead times will change with the volume of units ordered. After you have done adding all your items to the cart you can proceed to checkout.

## User Compliance Survey

After filling your cart and clicking checkout, you will be taken the "User Compliance Survey". This section is required by US Law and is mandatory for all purchases on the wholesale store.

Particle photon and electron products are restricted under ECCN number 5A992.c. Find out more about these restrictions [here](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/forms-documents/doc_view/335-supplement-no-1-to-part-774-category-5-part-ii-information-security).

### End user of the products

The first question is required to establish whether you will use the products yourself or sell/give the products to another individual or business. 

- As a business, the answer to this question will be "Yes" if you intend to use Particle products for internal uses and "No" for products you intend to sell. 
- As a distributor, the answer to this question is most likely “No”. 
- As an educator or the host of an event, the answer to this question will likely be "No" for products you intend to sell or give to other individuals or businesses. 

Checking the “No” option prompts another dropdown.

The additional question if you selected "No" asks whether you will collect the full name, physical address and end use of the end users of the products. If you have an e-commerce portal that stores this information or you will receive full invoices for the goods, you can answer "Yes" to this question. If you are not able to collect this information, we can not sell to you per US export law.

### Destination of the products

The next question asks about countries that the United States currently has trade embargoes with. Answer "Yes" to this question if you can guarantee that the products will not be sold to these countries. If you will ship Particle products to these countries, we can not sell to you per US export law.

The next question asks the Geography in which the device will be used. Again, choosing "Embargoed countries" will not allow us to ship to you.

- For distributors the most likely use cases should be "MISCELLANEOUS HOBBYIST ACTIVITIES (Without military applications)". All use cases are allowed but we will need additional information if you select "Military Applications".
- Educators or event hosts typically select "MISCELLANEOUS HOBBYIST ACTIVITIES (Without military applications)". All use cases are allowed but we will need additional information if you select "Military Applications".
