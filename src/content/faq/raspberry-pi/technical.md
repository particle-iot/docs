## Will the Particle software work on my Pi?

The Particle Pi software has been designed and primarily tested on the Raspberry Pi v3, but it will run on any Raspberry Pi device that has a connection to the Internet (Pi 1/2/3/Zero and Compute module).

Note that the pinouts and available GPIO for each version of the Raspberry Pi hardware is different. Please refer to the [Raspberry Pi datasheet](/datasheets/raspberrypi-datasheet) for more information about hardware compatibility with Particle development tools.

## Where can I learn more about the peripherals available on my Raspberry Pi?
[Pinout.xyz](http://pinout.xyz) is a great website that has an interactive pinout for the Raspberry Pi.
