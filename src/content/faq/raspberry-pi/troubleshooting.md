## My Raspberry Pi is in a weird state.

The magical fix all for Raspberry Pi devices in weird firmware states is to re-run the following command:  
`sudo particle-agent setup`


## I’m having an issue using a library with my Raspberry Pi.

First things first, please let us know by contacting us via our [Support Portal](http://support.particle.io) or by posting in the [Community Forums](http://community.particle.io/c/raspberry-pi).

We’re working on widespread Library compatibility for the Raspberry Pi, but it's entirely possible we may not be there yet. It is  possible that many libraries do not work with the Raspberry Pi yet, given that the integration with the Particle ecosystem is still in _beta_. There may also be libraries that work on the Raspberry Pi v3 but do not work on the Raspberry Pi v1 do to differences between peripheral availability and GPIO configuration.

We will do our best to correct these issues and bring the Raspberry Pi hardware platform up to the same level of completeness as our other development kits. In the meantime, thanks for your patience!


## I’m having trouble installing Raspbian on my SD card.
I'm sorry to hear that! Fortunately, the Raspberry Pi Foundation has a bunch of great resources available to help you get your SD card formatted and your Pi connected to the Internet. You can find a bunch of those resources at the links below:

- [General docs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/)
- [Setup guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/setup/)
- [Installing Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/)
