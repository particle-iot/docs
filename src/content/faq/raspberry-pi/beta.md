## How do I get access to the beta?
In order to get access to the beta, you first have to join the waiting list. Anyone can join the waitlist by going to [http://particle.io/particle-pi](http://particle.io/particle-pi) and signing up with their Particle account. If they don’t already have a Particle account, they can create one in that view.


## I’m already on the waiting list. Can I have access to the beta?
If you are a regular developer, the answer is probably not. If the person is a VIP enterprise customer or we have strong reason to give them early access, we should first ask the question -- does this person actually want access to a beta, or early access to a finished product? Will they be disappointed by something that is rough around the edges? If they pass those tests, they can be added to the beta program by Julien, Doc, or Bryce.


## When are you going to open up access to the beta?
We will expand access to the beta in the upcoming weeks, and hope to have access to the Particle Pi software fully unrestricted by the beginning of 2017.
