# Particle Workshops

---

Particle workshops are half- and full-day hands on explorations of the Particle ecosystem, including hardware, firmware and software. Each workshop is led by Particle employees or community advocates, and are designed to give developers new to IoT development the hands-on training they need to confidently build their own IoT solutions, at home, work, and beyond!

The workshops are broken into presentations intermixed with hands-on labs that reinforce presentation content.

## FAQ

**Do I have to attend a workshop to complete the labs?**

This site contains in-depth lab documents that complement in-person presentations delivered by Particle staff. Attendance of a workshop isn't required to follow along with these labs, but they are written under the assumption that you're attending a workshop and using workshop-provided hardware (i.e. A Particle Grove Start Kit, Particle Maker Kit, etc.) to complete the exercises. If you have all of the hardware needed for a given workshop, you can follow-along with the labs anywhere!
