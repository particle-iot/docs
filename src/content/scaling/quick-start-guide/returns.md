- Please use the [Particle web device doctor](/tools/doctor/) before attempting to return your device; most issues are fixable. 

- Submit a detailed description of the issues you are facing to your TAM at support@particle.io. The TAM will help you troubleshoot the devices. If the device is in warranty and deemed to be beyond repair due to a Particle issue, Particle will approve a replacement or apply the credit to your next invoice. 

- Warranty is one year from the date of shipment for Enterprise customers with a signed contract. 

- The warranty does not cover hardware damage due to a customer’s actions. If they smash it with a hammer that’s on you.
