#### Billing in the console

Billing information is available in the [Particle Console](https://console.particle.io/).

Select your organization in the upper left corner, then the **Billing & Usage** tab. Only organization administrators can see organization billing information.

For more information, see the [Billing & Usage](/getting-started/console/console/#billing-amp-usage) tab instructions.

#### Data operations

Data operations are one of the units of billing for Particle plans. To learn more, see [Getting started with data operations](/getting-started/billing/data-operations/).

Additionally, cellular devices may have additional constraints. See the [Cellular data guide](/getting-started/billing/cellular-data/).
