When you sign up for an enterprise plan, an organization will be created for you.

An organization:

#### Contains one or more Products that manage your device fleet.

A single product manages a fleet of devices that share a common hardware platform and typically run the same or similar firmware.

Your organization can contain as many products as you need; there is no additional charge for products and you can create, rename, and delete products through the [Particle console](https://console.particle.io).

Enterprise organizations don't have a developer sandbox, though each individual developer in the organization has their own developer sandbox. All enterprise fleets should be organized into products for shared access control and easier management.

Learn more in the [creating a product guide](/getting-started/products/creating-a-product/).

#### Allows access control across multiple products

Setting up cross-product access control makes it easy to add and remove developers as your team changes.

In many cases, developers will have access to all products by default, but you can also control access to specific products. For example, if you hire a contractor to work on a single product they can get access to only that product and not the rest of your products.

#### Centralizes all of your billing

The organization centralizes billing for multiple products. Usage is also aggregated annually instead of monthly in the growth plan.
