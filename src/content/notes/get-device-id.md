Using the Particle CLI, get the device ID of your device using the command:

```
particle identify
```

- The Device ID is a 24-character hexadecimal number (0-9, a-f).
- The command may print out other identity and version information as well.
- You will need the Device ID in later steps.
- The device must be in listening mode (blinking dark blue) for the command to work.

For example:

```
$ particle identify
Your device id is 1f00300016473532ffffffff
Your system firmware version is 2.3.0
```
