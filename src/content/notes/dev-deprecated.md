Particle Dev (Atom IDE) has been deprecated and is no longer available for download.

If you have it installed, we recommend removing it, as the code has not been maintained and there could be security issues in the packages that it is built on.

You should instead use [Particle Workbench](/getting-started/developer-tools/workbench/) for a local development environment for Mac, Linux, and Windows.
