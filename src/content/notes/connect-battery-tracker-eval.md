All 2G/3G cellular devices require a Li-Po battery for proper operation and cannot be powered by USB alone. For the Tracker, this includes:

- Tracker SoM (T524, T523)

For LTE Cat 1 devices, the battery is optional.

- Tracker SoM (T404, T402)

Be sure to use a recommended Particle, Sparkfun, or Adafruit battery. 

While there are many similar looking batteries available on Amazon, eBay, and Aliexpress, beware as the connector polarity is not standardized and many batteries ship with the connector wired in reverse, which will permanently damage your device! See the [battery reference](/hardware/power/batteries/) for more information.

Connect the battery to the LiPo connector (14) and turn on the power switches (15 and 16).
