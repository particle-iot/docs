Fleets of devices are managed using products. To learn more about products, see the [products introduction](/getting-started/products/introduction-to-products/).

Even if you are still prototyping and developing, it's a good idea to start by [creating a product](/getting-started/products/creating-a-product/) to make it easier when you do scale.

There are many ways to manage onboarding devices at scale. For examples, see:

- [Cellular manufacturing guide](/scaling/manufacturing/manufacturing-cellular/)
- [Import devices tool](/tools/cloud-tools/import-devices/)
