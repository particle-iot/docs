The device count in the enterprise plan includes all devices in all products in the enterprise organization.

Devices are added to the product from the console or API. When you order a devices from the wholesale store in tray or reel quantities, you will be emailed a list of Device IDs in the order that you can upload to the console.

A product device is not counted until it comes online at least once.

Once a device connects to the cloud the first time it will be counted as a billable device even if it does not connect to the cloud in future months.

For cellular devices, if the SIM is deactivated for the entire billing month, it will not be counted as a billable device. There is no proration for devices active only part of the month.

Product device counts are not affected by device claiming, whether unclaimed product devices, claimed to a single account, claimed to a team member, or claimed to a customer.
