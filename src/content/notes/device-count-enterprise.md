The device count in the enterprise plan includes all devices in all products in the enterprise organization.

Devices are added to the product from the console or API. When you order a devices from the wholesale store in tray or reel quantities, you will be emailed a list of Device IDs in the order that you can upload to the console.

A product device is not counted until it comes online at least once. At this point, on the enterprise plan it counts as a billable device for the month.

However, there is also a six month manufacturing grace period. After the device comes online for the first time, if in any of the six billing months the device does not come online, it will not be counted as a billable device. This only applies in the enterprise plan; in basic or free there is no manufacturing grace period. The manufacturing grace period allows you to set up and test devices in advance and not have to manually deactivate the devices in order to stop billing.

After the six month manufacturing grace period, the device will count as a billable device whether it comes online or not.

For cellular devices, if the SIM is deactivated for the entire billing month, it will not be counted as a billable device. There is no proration for devices active only part of the month.

Product device counts are not affected by device claiming, whether unclaimed product devices, claimed to a single account, claimed to a team member, or claimed to a customer.
