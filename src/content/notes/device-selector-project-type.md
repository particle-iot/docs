This determines the types of Particle modules that will be returned as solutions:

- Gateway devices are all-in-one, complete with an enclosure, ready to be deployed in your project.
- Developer kits are designed for experimentation, hobbyists, and prototyping.
- Production modules are designed for mass production. In many cases you will need to create your own circuit board to utilize the module.

If you are not sure, leave all of the boxes unchecked to return all possible solutions so you can compare the options.
