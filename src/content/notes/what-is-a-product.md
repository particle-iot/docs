A product groups together related devices that generally run the same firmware. It has many advantages:

- [Fleet deployment](/getting-started/cloud/ota-updates/#intelligent-firmware-releases), so you can release firmware to many devices at the same time.
- Upgrade firmware on offline devices, so devices can receive updates when they reconnect to the cloud.
- [Teams](/getting-started/console/team-access-controls/), so multiple users can work with the product devices.
- [API users](/reference/cloud-apis/api/#api-users), to allow fine-grained access control to Particle APIs from your servers.

If you need to create a product, see the [creating a product](/getting-started/products/creating-a-product/) tutorial.

Even if you are not yet to the point of scaling, you should start by creating a product first, as it will make it much easier to migrate to basic later.
