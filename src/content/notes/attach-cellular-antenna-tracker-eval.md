All cellular devices require an external cellular antenna to function properly. This is included with all development kits.

The antenna connector is a round U.FL connector and it is located on the top of the device. 

The Tracker SoM has a number of U.FL connectors; make sure you use the **CELL** connector (1) for the cellular antenna.
