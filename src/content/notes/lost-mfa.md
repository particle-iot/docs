If you have lost/replaced your mobile device and also do not have any of the one-time recovery passcodes at hand you will have to submit a support request.

In order for us to authenticate you (i.e. ensure that you are the actual account owner), we will need you to submit in your support request the last four digits and expiry date of the credit card associated with your account.

If you do not have a credit card associated with your account, please include as many of the following as you can in your support request: 

- Number and type of device(s) claimed to your account
- Name(s) and Device IDs (link for information about how to find Device IDs) of devices claimed to your account
- Name(s) of user firmware sketches stored in the Web IDE
- Any other data that will help us determine that you are in fact the account owner

Important - please note that this process may take upwards of 1 business day to resolve, and will require at least one back-and-forth with a Support Agent via your registered Particle email address.
