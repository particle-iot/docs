An organization groups together one or more products so they:

- Have one bill for all products in the organization
- Pool usage across all products in the organization
- Organization level users that have access to all products
- You can still have product level users with access to specific products, if needed
- There is no per-product fee for products in your growth organization, however the devices, data operations, and cellular data usage by the devices in those products count against your organization's total usage.
- A user can belong to multiple organizations if needed
