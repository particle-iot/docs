To configure Wi-Fi using the Particle CLI, use the following command from a Terminal or Command Prompt window:

```
particle serial wifi
```

This will interactively prompt you for the information needed to connect to your Wi-Fi network. The device must be in listening mode (blinking dark blue) for this command to work.

The [Particle CLI command reference](/reference/developer-tools/cli/#particle-serial-wifi) includes more information about this and other comamnds.
