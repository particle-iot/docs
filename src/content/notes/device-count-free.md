The free plan has a limit of 100 devices of any type (cellular or Wi-Fi). More specifically, the limit includes:

- All of the devices claimed to the user that are not in a product.
- All devices in all free tier products owned by this user, regardless of claiming.

What this means is that the device list in your developer sandbox account is not a complete lists of all devices that contribute to your free plan limits.

These **do not** contribute to the free plan limit:

- Devices that are claimed to your account, but are part of a free plan product that you are a team member of, but not the owner.
- Devices that are claimed to your account, but are part of a growth or enterprise tier product.

#### Product devices

For free tier products, devices are added to the product from the console or API. When you order a devices from the wholesale store in tray or reel quantities, you will be emailed a list of Device IDs in the order that you can upload to the console.

A product device is not counted until it comes online at least once. At that point, it will be counted regardless of whether it comes online within a billing month.
