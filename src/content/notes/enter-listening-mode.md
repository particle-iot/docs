The next step requires that the device be in listening mode, blinking dark blue, and connected to your computer by USB. 

If this is your first time configuring this device it probably already is in listening mode.

If not, you can use one of the following methods:

#### Using the CLI

From a command prompt or terminal window:

```
particle usb start-listening
```

If this does not cause the status LED to change to blinking dark blue you will need to use the buttons.

#### Using buttons

Hold down the MODE button. On the Photon, this button is marked SETUP.

Continue to hold down the MODE or SETUP button until the status LED blinks dark blue. This often happens quickly, but could take 10 seconds or more in rare situations.
