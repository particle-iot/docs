All Asset Tracker devices are intended to be used in a product, not as developer devices. This makes it easy to manage a fleet of asset trackers, allowing per-fleet and per-device configuration settings, and features like fleet mapping. 

It's OK if you're starting out with a single Tracker; you can create a free prototyping level product that only has one device in it. From the [console](https://console.particle.io), click on the **Products** icon (1) then **New Product** (2).

When you create the product, be sure to select **Asset Tracker (Cellular** as the type.

You will probably also want to opt into the storage of geolocation data. In the **Settings** (gear) icon, check the box to enable it. The privacy policy can be found [here](https://www.particle.io/legal/privacy/).

You can reuse this product for more than one tracker device, you don't need to create a separate product for each device.
