Connect your device using a USB cable to your computer.

- Make sure you are using a USB data cable. Many inexpensive charger cables only power the device and do not support USB data, and will not work for programming your device by USB.
- The Tracker One and Tracker Evaluation board require a USB C cable. Most other Particle devices include a Micro USB 2 connector. 
- Some evaluation boards have more than one USB connector. Make sure you use the MCU USB connector.
