Billing is measured in blocks.

- A block includes {{growthTierDataOperationsUnit}} Data Operations ({{growthTierDataOperationsComma}}) per month.
- Up to {{growthTierDevices}} devices.
- Up to {{growthTierDataOperationsCellularData}} of cellular data per month, pooled across all devices.
- Blocks are specific to cellular, Tracker, or Wi-Fi. Usage is aggregated for all devices in all products in your growth organization of the same class. For example, Electrons, Borons, and B-Series are all cellular devices that can share the same block even though they are in different products.
- Cellular blocks are {{growthBlockCellularPrice}} per month per block
- Tracker blocks are {{growthBlockTrackerPrice}} per month per block
- Wi-Fi blocks are {{growthBlockWiFiPrice}} per month per block
