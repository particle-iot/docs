Billing is measured in blocks.

- A block includes {{basicTierDataOperationsUnit}} Data Operations ({{basicTierDataOperationsComma}}) per month.
- Up to {{basicTierDevices}} devices.
- Up to {{basicTierDataOperationsCellularData}} of cellular data per month, pooled across all devices.
- Blocks are specific to cellular, Tracker, or Wi-Fi. Usage is aggregated for all devices in all products in your basic plan organization of the same class. For example, Electrons, Borons, and B-Series are all cellular devices that can share the same block even though they are in different products.
- Blocks are {{basicBlockPrice}} per month per block
