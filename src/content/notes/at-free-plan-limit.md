Note that there are three different limits that can be exceeded in the free plan:

- The number of devices
- The number of data operations you are using
- The amount of cellular data you are using

### Device limit

If you are at the free plan device limit of 100 devices, there are two options:

- [Migrate to basic](/getting-started/billing/migrating-to-basic/)
- Reduce the number of devices in your free plan account

Note that not every device in your free developer sandbox device list may count toward the 100 device limit. See the additional topics below.

#### Data limit

If you hit the data operations or cellular data limit, your account will be paused and no new data operations will be allowed until the beginning of the next billing cycle, when the counts reset to zero. 

Visit the Billing & Usage tab in [the console](https://console.particle.io) to see how close to the limits you are.
