Blinking white is uncommon.

- If you invoked the factory reset button sequence the device will fast blink white. The factory reset feature is not recommended as it doesn't actually factory reset the device and could make the situation worse.
- If the device has insufficient power, the device may appear to blink white. This is because the device powers on an the status LED turns on white, then the power level drops and the brownout detector resets the device, which causes it to consume less power, and turn back on, and the process repeats.
