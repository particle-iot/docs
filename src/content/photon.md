# Particle Photon: Wi-Fi
![Image of the Photon](/assets/images/photon-kit.jpg)

**The Photon has been discontinued. The Argon or Photon 2 are recommended substitutes.**

The Photon is a $19 tiny Wi-Fi IoT device for creating connected projects and products for the Internet of Things. It's easy to use, it's powerful, and it's connected to the cloud. The board is powered by a Cypress Wi-Fi chip alongside a powerful STM32 ARM Cortex M3 microcontroller.
