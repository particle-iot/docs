Common Questions
===

**Where can I get more firmware information, like a guide?**
Most of our firmware solutions are now explained in depth, located in our new and improved {{#if photon}}[Photon Guide](/guide/getting-started/intro/photon){{/if}}{{#if core}}[Core Guide](/guide/getting-started/intro/core){{/if}}.

**Do Particle devices play well with IFTTT?**
Yes, and that *how-to* is located in our [IFTTT features section](/guide/tools-and-features/ifttt).

**Do you have Webhooks and JS-Plugins?**
Yes, you can find more information on both of these at [Webhooks features section](/guide/tools-and-features/webhooks).

**I am hosting a Hackathon/Program that includes Particle - do you have any suggestions?**

Yup! [Here are our best practices](/guide/getting-started/hackathon) about setting devices up for a Hackathon.

Feel free to contact [hello @ particle dot io] with **subject line: *"Sponsorship Inquiry for Particle"* **for any additional information about this. Please include as many details about your event and what sort of participation you’re interested in from Particle and allow a week for response.

## How do I get my deviceID [device ID] ?
* Put the device into [Listening Mode](/guide/getting-started/modes/photon/#listening-mode) mode while being plugged into a computer via USB
* Issue `particle serial identify` from the [particle CLI](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli)
	and it should return the deviceID.
