Returns
===

Wow. Never thought we’d see you here. This is awkward. Well, since you’re already here, you probably want some information about returning your Particle products. That’s okay, we’re not sad. We want you to love your Particle experience, so we’re here to help you out. 

### 60-Day Unopened Return Policy

If you are not 100% satisfied with your order, we will be happy to arrange a return for any unused items purchased within 60 days. Simply visit support.particle.io with your order number, email address you used to place the order, and a brief description of why you’d like this return.

### Opened Product Return Policy

Sometimes you can’t tell a product is not for you until you take it for a test drive. Not a problem, we’ve got your back. We can offer advice, troubleshoot or diagnose any issue that might have come up. First, look for troubleshooting tips and assistance on your issue on our [documentation page](https://docs.particle.io/support/troubleshooting/common-issues). If you don’t find it there, our amazing [community](https://community.particle.io/) can most likely help you out. If you still are having trouble, visit us at our [support portal](https://support.particle.io).

If we determine that something is wrong with your product due to a manufacturing defect or error, we will be happy to replace your item(s) as needed. Please visit  our [support portal](https://support.particle.io) and let us know your order number, the product you’re having issues with, and a detailed description of the problems you’re seeing. For broken products, please include pictures, they are worth a thousand words.  

### Damaged in Shipment

Please visit our [support portal](https://support.particle.io) and let us know what happened. Include your order number, the product with a brief description of the damage and a picture (if possible). This information helps us assess our packaging so we can prevent similar problems in the future. We’ll get replacements for the damaged goods to you as quickly as possible.
