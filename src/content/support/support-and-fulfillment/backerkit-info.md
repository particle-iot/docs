### Can I upgrade my Kickstarter Pledge Package?

You can! Once you're logged into your BackerKit account, you will be able to see your current pledge amount and package. You can either update your entire pledge by clicking the small upgrade button. If you'd like to just add to your current pledge, the add-ons page will appear after you have completed the question portion of the survey. You’ll be able to add on Electrons, Kits, and T-Shirts!

Feel free to the link below to jump straight to your cart for more Add-Ons!

### I upgraded my pledge or added add-ons - when will my credit card be charged for these additions?

Your credit will not be charged until your package is ready and scheduled to ship. If you added Photons or a Photon Kit to your order that means your add-ons have already been charged and your Photon have shipped.

### Other common Kickstarter issues

**I pledged extra for additional items.**
BackerKit automatically pulls in the amount you pledged and allows you to specify which items you want to get with your additional credits. If you have any issues please do not hesitate to contact us with questions.

**I think I might be moving before early February 2016.** As mentioned above, you will always have access to your BackerKit profile and will be able to update your shipping address yourself prior to lockdown. Prior to January 15 feel free to use this [link](https://spark-electron-cellular-dev-kit-with-a-simple-data.backerkit.com/) to change your address and other account information.

**I have not received a survey.** We have already emailed these out so please email us at [ particle@io dot io] if you haven’t received the survey in your inbox.
