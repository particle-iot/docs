Online Store & Shipping Questions
===

### How can I view my order?

If you ordered directly from our store and would like to check the status of your order
please click on the “Check My Order” link below. You'll need your **OrderID #** (given at checkout and in the order confirmation email) and the **email address** that was used to checkout.

<a href="https://dashboard.trycelery.com/status" class="button">Check My Order</a> 

### How can I update my address?

If you have placed a pre-order with us that has not yet been fulfilled you can update your address as long as your
<a>Fulfillment</a> status is not already in {{{support-popup '**processing**' 'img' 'invoice_status_processing.png'}}} or {{{support-popup '**fulfilled**' 'img' 'invoice_status.png'}}} stages. 

If your order is in the {{{support-popup '**payment = unpaid**' 'img' 'invoice_status_unpaid.png'}}} stage, it is possible to update your address on your own using the same **OrderID #** and **email address** provided at checkout. 

Once you are logged into your order dashboard, click the **edit** button near your {{{support-popup '**shipping**' 'img' 'invoice_shipping.png'}}} section and update your mailing address.

### How can I update my credit card information?

Similar to updating you address, updating your **credit card information** is just a simple. Again, if your order is in the {{{support-popup '**payment = unpaid**' 'img' 'invoice_status_unpaid.png'}}} stage, you will be able to update the credit card on file using the same **OrderID #** and **email address** provided at checkout to sign into the dashboard.


Once you are logged into the dashboard, click the **edit** button near your {{{support-popup '**Payment Source**' 'img' 'invoice_payment.png'}}} section to update your credit card information.

<a href="https://dashboard.trycelery.com/status" class="button">Update Credit Card</a>


### Can I Cancel My Order?

Order cancellations occur on a case by case basis as certain orders may be harder to cancel than others. *For example,* if you want to cancel your order but the order has already been paid and shipped out to you, then cancelling the order would be a little difficult, given the circumstance.

If you feel as if you have good reason to cancel your purchase with us, please file a cancellation claim below.

<form>
	<a> <input class="button" type="button" value="Cancel My Order" onClick="script: Zenbox.show(); return false;" /> </a>
