# The Particle air quality monitoring kit


The Particle Air Quality Monitoring Kit is designed to teach you how to investigate the air around you using Particle IoT hardware and software. This kit includes everything you need to build your monitoring station as well as the tutorials and documentation to keep you learning. 

This kit is built around the Particle Argon, our latest Wi-Fi development board. You'll learn how to provision your Argon, build the device, and wire and deploy your firmware over-the-air. Once you're up and running, you'll then learn how to output measurement data on the included OLED and how to forward those same sensor readings to the Particle Device Cloud.

The Air Quality Kit includes a Particle Argon and three specialized sensors to measure temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and particulates in the atmosphere. All necessary wires to complete the project are included in the kit â€” this goes for wires, an antennae, and even a LiPo battery.
