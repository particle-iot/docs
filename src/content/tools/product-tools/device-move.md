This control moves devices into a product from your developer sandbox or from another product.

**Moving a device into a product may have billing implications**, especially when moving devices from the free developer sandbox into a growth tier product, where additional devices could require additional blocks to accommodate the added devices. 


**Make sure destination has a default product release**

After moving the device, it will need to be flashed with the new product firmware. This is automatic if the destination product has a default firmware release.

If it does not, you will need to lock and flash, or mark as developer device and manually flash the firmware.

**Beware of wildcard PRODUCT_ID**

If you are using the wildcard product ID (`PRODUCT_ID(PLATFORM_ID)`), instead of your specific product ID in your product firmware, the version comparison is only done by version number. Thus if the destination product has the same version number as the source product, it will not get flashed with the new product firmware correct. You can correct this using Lock and Flash, then unlocking.


**Offline devices and quarantine**

If you move devices from a product into another product and they are offline, you may see them appear in quarantine in the source product. This is normal, because the device will go online with the old firmware, then the cloud will determine that they're part of a new product, then get the new product firmware. Once the device comes online with the new product firmware successfully they'll be removed from quarantine on the old product.

Do not approve the devices in quarantine in the old product, or they may be moved back to the old product!


**Disable auto-approve new product devices in source product**

If you are not using a wildcard product ID you must disable auto-approve new product devices in the source product before moving devices if you are moving devices that are currently offline.

The reason is that when the devices come online after moving, they'll still have the old product firmware. If auto-approve is enabled, they'll then get added back into the old product, negating the effects of the move.
