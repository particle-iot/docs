## Requirements

If you are using the Chrome web browser (version 89 or higher) on Windows, Mac, Linux, or Chromebook, you can use the web-based USB serial monitor. It does not currently work on any other browsers as it requires the [WebSerial API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API) which is not yet widely supported.

This is particularly useful if you have a Chromebook, or cannot install additional software on your computer.
