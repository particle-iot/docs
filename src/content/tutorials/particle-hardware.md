*Finding the right Particle hardware for your project*

- If you want an off-the-shelf, complete device with little or no hardware design required, see [off-the-shelf complete](#off-the-shelf-complete) below.
- One way to start finding the right device is whether you're a hobbyist, prototyping, or producing a product. To start there, see [prototype or production](#prototype-or-production) below.
- Another way to start is by deciding on [cellular or Wi-Fi](#cellular-or-wi-fi) first.


## Off-the-shelf complete


### Tracker One

If you want an off-the-shelf device can requires little or no hardware design, the [Tracker One](/datasheets/asset-tracking/tracker-one/) is a complete system with a waterproof IP67-rated enclosure. In includes cellular connectivity, GNSS (GPS) and Wi-Fi geolocation, and motion detection.

## Prototype or production

### Prototyping

For easy prototyping, devices with pins on the bottom can easily be installed in a solderless breadboard. The Argon and Boron (Gen 3) are the best choices for prototyping.

![Breadboard](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/bread1.jpg)

Gen 3 devices use the Adafruit Feather form-factory so easily add accessories like sensors and displays, with no wiring required.

![Boron GPS FeatherWing](/assets/images/gps-display-featherwing.jpg)

Even though these devices are ideal for prototyping, you can also scale with the Argon and Boron. For example, you may mount the device in a socket in your own custom circuit board when you're ready to scale, instead of using solderless breadboards or off-the-shelf Feather adapters.

There are also evaluation kits for the B Series SoM, Tracker SoM, and E Series modules that can be used for prototyping with those modules.

If you're not sure whether you want cellular or Wi-Fi, see [Cellular or Wi-Fi](#cellular-or-wi-fi) below.

- The Boron 2G/3G (BRN314KIT) should not be deployed in the United States due to the [2G/3G shutdown](/tutorials/cellular-connectivity/introduction/#united-states).
- The Boron LTE Cat M1 (BRN404KIT) is the recommended model for the United States.
- Can be powered by USB, rechargeable LiPo battery, or an external power supply.
- A battery is included with the Boron 2G/3G (BRN314) as the cellular modem uses more power for brief periods of time than a standard laptop USB port will supply.
- All Boron devices include a built-in Particle SIM card ([free for use](/tutorials/device-cloud/introduction/#free-tier) up to certain limits, no credit card required).
- Starter kits include a mini-breadboard, USB cable, two resistors (220 ohm), one red LED, and one photodiode.
- ARG-STRTKT includes a variety of [Grove](/datasheets/accessories/gen3-accessories/#grove-starter-kit) sensors and a display.

There are numerous ways to expand Gen 3 devices:

- [Adafruit FeatherWing](/community/feather/) compatible modules can add things like displays, sensors, relays, with no wiring necessary.
- [SparkFun Qwiic](/community/qwiic/) and Adafruit Stemma-QT modules provide a way to add features connected by a small I2C cable. Multiple modules can be chained together, as well.
  - Environment sensors (pressure, temperature, humidity) like the BME280
  - Buttons and indicator buttons
  - Load cell adapter (weight sensor)
  - Distance and proximity sensors
  - Thermocouple adapters
  - Relays
  - Keypads
  - Small displays
- [Grove](/datasheets/accessories/gen3-accessories/#grove-starter-kit) sensors and displays connect to digital, analog, I2C, and serial devices with a simple 4-pin cable.


Its also possible to prototype with these easy to use modules, then include the same functionality on a custom board later. The Adafruit and SparkFun designs are all open-source and include hardware design files for EagleCAD.

The [Beyond Prototyping Tutorial](/tutorials/learn-more/beyond-prototyping/) shows examples of how you can move from prototyping to custom circuit boards, with example designs.

For more information about the Boron, see [Cellular - Boron](#boron-prototyping-gen-3-cellular-) below.

For more information about the Argon, see [Wi-Fi - Argon](#argon-prototyping-gen-3-wi-fi-) below.

### Production

When producing at scale, you may prefer to use devices that you reflow solder to your own base board (E Series, P1, and Tracker SoM) or securely mount in a M.2 socket (B Series SoM).

If you're not sure whether you want cellular or Wi-Fi, see [Cellular or Wi-Fi](#cellular-or-wi-fi) below.

While you can use prototyping devices at scale, if you will be needing devices over a long period of time, production devices will generally be maintained for a longer period of time. For example, the Electron (prototyping) was discontinued before the E Series (production), even though both have similar hardware.

The software for prototyping and production devices is similar. It's often possible to use a single code base to work with both types of modules. And, in many cases, across both Gen 2 and Gen 3 devices, or across both cellular and Wi-Fi devices.


#### B Series SoM (Gen 3 Cellular)

{{blurb name="b-series-overview"}}

For more information about the B Series SoM, see [Cellular - B Series SoM](#b-series-som-production-gen-3-cellular-) below.


#### Tracker SoM (Gen 3 Cellular)

{{blurb name="tracker-som-overview"}}

For more information about the Tracker SoM, see [Cellular - Tracker SoM](#tracker-gen-3-cellular-) below.


#### E Series (Gen 2 Cellular)

{{blurb name="e-series-overview"}}

For more information about the E Series module, see [Cellular - E Series](#e-series-production-gen-2-cellular-) below.


#### P1 (Gen 2 Wi-Fi)

<div align="center"><img src="/assets/images/p1-vector.png" width="200"></div>

The P1 module is a Wi-Fi module that you reflow solder to your own custom base board. It's smaller and less expensive than the Argon.

{{blurb name="argon-p1-table"}}

For more information about the P1 module, see [Wi-Fi - P1](/#p1-production-gen-2-wi-fi-) below.


## Cellular or Wi-Fi

A common question to start with is how you want to connect to the Internet.

### Cellular

While cellular hardware is initially more expensive, the total cost to onboard a customer with cellular may be lower due to the other expenses involved in Wi-Fi deployments:

- No requirement to provide a method of configuring Wi-Fi credentials, such as a custom mobile app
- No dependence on the customer's Wi-Fi network, which may be inconsistent 
- No troubleshooting site-specific Wi-Fi configuration issues

### Wi-Fi

There are two currently available Wi-Fi devices, the P1 and the Argon:

{{blurb name="argon-p1-table"}}

For product creators, Wi-Fi devices require a way to set the Wi-Fi credentials for the user's Wi-Fi network. This is typically done using a custom mobile app. The P1 has an available Device Setup SDK that makes it easy to create a custom white-label mobile app to set up the P1. This does not exist for the Argon at this time.

### Both Cellular and Wi-Fi

There are no Particle devices that include both cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity in a single device. While the Tracker SoM and Tracker One include cellular and Wi-Fi, the Tracker Wi-Fi can only be used for geolocation and cannot be used to connect to the Internet.

If you want an option of cellular or Wi-Fi in your product, you'll need two or three different SKUs, however the best choice is:

- Wi-Fi: Argon
- Cellular: Boron LTE (North America), Boron 2G/3G (Global except NORAM)

These modules are pin-compatible in the Feather form-factor, so you can make two versions of your hardware, one cellular and one Wi-Fi, which you can use depending on local connectivity, for example.

### Ethernet

![](/assets/images/accessories/ethernet-featherwing/ethernet-featherwing.png)


The Argon and Boron are compatible with the [Ethernet Featherwing](/datasheets/accessories/gen3-accessories/#ethernet-featherwing). 

With the B Series SoM you can implement Ethernet on your custom base board fairly simply using the WIZnet W5500 chipset. The [B Series Eval Board](/datasheets/boron/b-series-eval-board/) includes this circuitry.

You can also include Ethernet functionality on your Tracker SoM base board, but this is an unusual configuration and the [Tracker SoM Eval board](/datasheets/asset-tracking/tracker-som-eval-board/) does not include Ethernet. 

It is not possible to use Ethernet with Gen 2 devices (Photon, P1, Electron, or E Series).

Ethernet is only intended for use as a method of connecting to the Internet. It is not intended to connect to isolated Ethernet segments such as Ethernet control networks, and relay information over cellular, for example. See the [AN037 Ethernet](/datasheets/app-notes/an037-ethernet/) application note for more information.
