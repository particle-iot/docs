*Finding the right Particle hardware for your project*

- If you want an off-the-shelf, complete device with little or no hardware design required, see [off-the-shelf complete](#off-the-shelf-complete) below.
- One way to start finding the right device is whether you're a hobbyist, prototyping, or producing a product. To start there, see [prototype or production](#prototype-or-production) below.
- Another way to start is by deciding on [cellular or Wi-Fi](#cellular-or-wi-fi) first.


## Off-the-shelf complete


### Tracker One

## Prototype or production

### Prototyping

For easy prototyping, devices with pins on the bottom can easily be installed in a solderless breadboard. The Argon and Boron (Gen 3) are the best choices for prototyping.

![Breadboard](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/bread1.jpg)

Gen 3 devices use the Adafruit Feather form-factory so easily add accessories like sensors and displays, with no wiring required.

![Boron GPS FeatherWing](/assets/images/gps-display-featherwing.jpg)

Even though these devices are ideal for prototyping, you can also scale with the Argon and Boron. For example, you may mount the device in a socket in your own custom circuit board when you're ready to scale, instead of using solderless breadboards or off-the-shelf Feather adapters.

There are also evaluation kits for the B Series SoM, Tracker SoM, and E Series modules that can be used for prototyping with those modules.

If you're not sure whether you want cellular or Wi-Fi, see [Cellular or Wi-Fi](#cellular-or-wi-fi) below.

- The Boron 2G/3G (BRN314KIT) should not be deployed in the United States due to the [2G/3G shutdown](/tutorials/cellular-connectivity/introduction/#united-states).
- The Boron LTE Cat M1 (BRN404KIT) is the recommended model for the United States.
- Can be powered by USB, rechargeable LiPo battery, or an external power supply.
- A battery is included with the Boron 2G/3G (BRN314) as the cellular modem uses more power for brief periods of time than a standard laptop USB port will supply.
- All Boron devices include a built-in Particle SIM card ([free for use](/tutorials/device-cloud/introduction/#free-tier) up to certain limits, no credit card required).
- Starter kits include a mini-breadboard, USB cable, two resistors (220 ohm), one red LED, and one photodiode.
- ARG-STRTKT includes a variety of [Grove](/datasheets/accessories/gen3-accessories/#grove-starter-kit) sensors and a display.

There are numerous ways to expand Gen 3 devices:

- [Adafruit FeatherWing](/community/feather/) compatible modules can add things like displays, sensors, relays, with no wiring necessary.
- [SparkFun Qwiic](/community/qwiic/) and Adafruit Stemma-QT modules provide a way to add features connected by a small I2C cable. Multiple modules can be chained together, as well.
  - Environment sensors (pressure, temperature, humidity) like the BME280
  - Buttons and indicator buttons
  - Load cell adapter (weight sensor)
  - Distance and proximity sensors
  - Thermocouple adapters
  - Relays
  - Keypads
  - Small displays
- [Grove](/datasheets/accessories/gen3-accessories/#grove-starter-kit) sensors and displays connect to digital, analog, I2C, and serial devices with a simple 4-pin cable.


Its also possible to prototype with these easy to use modules, then include the same functionality on a custom board later. The Adafruit and SparkFun designs are all open-source and include hardware design files for EagleCAD.

The [Beyond Prototyping Tutorial](/tutorials/learn-more/beyond-prototyping/) shows examples of how you can move from prototyping to custom circuit boards, with example designs.

For more information about the Boron, see [Cellular - Boron](#boron-prototyping-gen-3-cellular-) below.

For more information about the Argon, see [Wi-Fi - Argon](#argon-prototyping-gen-3-wi-fi-) below.

### Production

When producing at scale, you may prefer to use devices that you reflow solder to your own base board (E Series, P1, and Tracker SoM) or securely mount in a M.2 socket (B Series SoM).

If you're not sure whether you want cellular or Wi-Fi, see [Cellular or Wi-Fi](#cellular-or-wi-fi) below.

While you can use prototyping devices at scale, if you will be needing devices over a long period of time, production devices will generally be maintained for a longer period of time. For example, the Electron (prototyping) was discontinued before the E Series (production), even though both have similar hardware.

The software for prototyping and production devices is similar. It's often possible to use a single code base to work with both types of modules. And, in many cases, across both Gen 2 and Gen 3 devices, or across both cellular and Wi-Fi devices.


#### B Series SoM (Gen 3 Cellular)

{{!-- BEGIN shared-blurb b69a2546-9baa-11ec-b909-0242ac120002 --}}
![B Series](/assets/images/b-series/b-series-top.png)

The B Series SoM (system-on-a-module) is similar to the Boron in that it is a 3rd-generation cellular device. It plugs into an M.2 NGFF connector on your custom circuit board and is intended for mass production use.

One of the benefits is that many of the extra features on the Boron have been omitted from the SoM, so you can implement a custom solution as necessary. For example, rather than duplicating the buttons and status LED on the SoM, you can put them on an external control panel for your product, or omit them entirely.

<sup>1</sup>The PMIC (power management IC) and fuel gauge are used with battery-powered applications. They're omitted from the SoM as they are not needed for externally powered solutions (grid or automotive power, for example). Additionally, you may want to use different models if you are making a solar-powered device, or using a different battery technology or multiple battery pack.

<sup>2</sup>The built-in Particle SIM card is [free for use](/tutorials/device-cloud/introduction/#free-tier) up to certain limits, no credit card required.

## Cellular or Wi-Fi

A common question to start with is how you want to connect to the Internet.

### Cellular

While cellular hardware is initially more expensive, the total cost to onboard a customer with cellular may be lower due to the other expenses involved in Wi-Fi deployments:

- No requirement to provide a method of configuring Wi-Fi credentials, such as a custom mobile app
- No dependence on the customer's Wi-Fi network, which may be inconsistent 
- No troubleshooting site-specific Wi-Fi configuration issues

{{!-- END shared-blurb --}}

For product creators, Wi-Fi devices require a way to set the Wi-Fi credentials for the user's Wi-Fi network. This is typically done using a custom mobile app. The P1 has an available Device Setup SDK that makes it easy to create a custom white-label mobile app to set up the P1. This does not exist for the Argon at this time.

#### P1 (Production Gen 2 Wi-Fi)

<div align="center"><img src="/assets/images/p1-vector.png" width="200"></div>

The P1 is intended for production use. Even though the P1 is an older Gen 2 design, it is still safe to design to the P1-form factor.

### Both Cellular and Wi-Fi

There are no Particle devices that include both cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity in a single device. While the Tracker SoM and Tracker One include cellular and Wi-Fi, the Tracker Wi-Fi can only be used for geolocation and cannot be used to connect to the Internet.

If you want an option of cellular or Wi-Fi in your product, you'll need two or three different SKUs, however the best choice is:

- Wi-Fi: Argon
- Cellular: Boron LTE (North America), Boron 2G/3G (Global except NORAM)

These modules are pin-compatible in the Feather form-factor, so you can make two versions of your hardware, one cellular and one Wi-Fi, which you can use depending on local connectivity, for example.

### Ethernet

![](/assets/images/accessories/ethernet-featherwing/ethernet-featherwing.png)


The Argon and Boron are compatible with the [Ethernet FeatherWing](/datasheets/accessories/gen3-accessories/#ethernet-featherwing). 

With the B Series SoM you can implement Ethernet on your custom base board fairly simply using the WIZnet W5500 chipset. The [B Series Eval Board](/datasheets/boron/b-series-eval-board/) includes this circuitry.

You can also include Ethernet functionality on your Tracker SoM base board, but this is an unusual configuration and the [Tracker SoM Eval board](/datasheets/asset-tracking/tracker-som-eval-board/) does not include Ethernet. 

It is not possible to use Ethernet with Gen 2 devices (Photon, P1, Electron, or E Series).

Ethernet is only intended for use as a method of connecting to the Internet. It is not intended to connect to isolated Ethernet segments such as Ethernet control networks, and relay information over cellular, for example. See the [AN037 Ethernet](/datasheets/app-notes/an037-ethernet/) application note for more information.
