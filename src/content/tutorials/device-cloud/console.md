# Console

The [Particle Console](https://console.particle.io) is your
centralized IoT command center. It provides interfaces to make
interacting with and managing Particle devices easy. This guide is
divided into two main sections, [tools for developers](#developer-tools)
and [tools to manage product fleets](#product-tools).

**Note:** The Console does not yet work in Microsoft Internet Explorer including Edge. Please use another browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, to access the Console. If you're experiencing rendering issues, turn off any ad blocking extensions you may be using.

## Developer Tools

While actively developing an IoT project or product, the Console offers
many helpful features to make prototyping a breeze. See the last time a
device connected, debug a firmware issue by observing event logs,
set up a webhook to send data to an external service, and more.

### Devices

The Devices page allows you to see a list of the devices associated with
your account. Here, you can see specific information about each device,
including it's unique Device ID, it's name, the type of device (i.e.
Photon or Electron) the last time it connected
to the Particle cloud, and whether or not the device is currently
online.

<img src="{{assets}}/images/console/devices-view.png"
class="full-width"/>

You can also take certain actions on devices from this view, such as
renaming the device and unclaiming it from your account.

### Event Logs

The Logs feature provides a clean interface to view event information in real-time, just from your devices. We're hoping that this is handy both while debugging code during development, and checking out recent activity on your device once you power-on your finished project. Tailored around improving the experience of browsing logs, the page provides a handful of tools, like filtering, modifiers which enable you to narrow down your search for events, making it easier to view only the data that is relevant to you. In this view, you'll only see events that come in while the browser window is open.

To visit the page go to [https://console.particle.io/events](https://console.particle.io/events)

<img src="/assets/images/eventlogs/full.png" class="full-width" />

#### Logs

The left side of the page contains a real-time log of events passing through the cloud. You'll get the name, data, timestamp and the device name associated with each event as it comes in. Oh Yeah! And, if you click on the event, you can see the event data.

#### How to publish events

Publishing events can be achieved in multiple ways:
- Using `particle.publish` in firmware ([docs](/reference/device-os/firmware/#particle-publish-))
- Using Particle API JS's `publishEvent` ([docs](/reference/SDKs/javascript/#publishevent))
- Using the Publish event button in the Event Logs page:

<img src="/assets/images/eventlogs/publish.png" class="full-width" />

#### Filtering the events

Filters let you narrow down your search and only see events that are relevant.

You can filter the events by writing anything in the input. Your query will be compared with the event name, data, publisher, and date.
<img src="/assets/images/eventlogs/filter_word.gif" class="full-width" />

#### Modifiers

Besides writing in the input, you can use modifiers to narrow down your search even further. You can see the list of modifiers by pressing the Advanced button.

<img src="/assets/images/eventlogs/filters.png" class="full-width" />

- `device` Filter by device ID (example: `device:34003d001647353236343012`). The `device` modifier is not usable when viewing a device's individual page, as the stream is already listening only for events coming from that device.
- `event` Filter by event name (example: `event:status`)
- `range` Only show events that have a number value between min and max (`range:min-max`, example: `range:20-100`)
- `data` Filter by data (example: `data:device-is-ok`)

Modifiers can be grouped: `device:34003d001647353236343012 event:temperature range:30-50`

** Note: Having multiple modifiers of the same type is not yet supported (you can not filter by 2 device IDs) **

You can combine modifiers with a query. In this example, we combine the query '35' with the modifier 'event:temperature'. The page will only show events named `temperature` that have `35` as their data.
<img src="/assets/images/eventlogs/filter_multiple.png" class="full-width" />

#### Viewing event data

To view more details about an event, click on it. If the event data is a valid JSON string, it will be displayed in a way that makes it easier to read and understand.

<img src="/assets/images/eventlogs/eventdata_pretty.png" />

To view the raw version of the JSON, click on the `RAW` button.

<img src="/assets/images/eventlogs/eventdata_raw.png" class="full-width" />

You can copy the data to the clipboard if you click on the copy button.

** Note: You can also navigate through the event list by using the up and down arrow keys **

#### Clearing the event logs

You can empty the list of received events by pressing on the Clear button.

#### Pausing the event stream

If lots of events are coming through, you can put events in a queue by clicking on the Pause button. This should help you navigate through the list of events that you have already received.

To make the events from the queue visible click on the Play button.

<img src="/assets/images/eventlogs/queue.png" class="full-width" />

### Integrations

Integrations allow you to send data from your Particle devices to
external tools and services. The Console provides an interface to
create, view, edit, and delete Particle integrations.

<img src="{{assets}}/images/console/integrations-view.png"
class="full-width"/>

For more information on how to start using integrations, you should
check out:

- [Webhooks
guide](/guide/tools-and-features/webhooks/)
- [Webhooks
tutorial](/tutorials/device-cloud/webhooks/)
- [Azure IoT Hub
tutorial](/tutorials/integrations/azure-iot-hub/)
- [Google Cloud Platform
tutorial](/tutorials/integrations/google-cloud-platform/)

### Billing

You should also use the Console to view and manage billing information.
Some of the things to use the billing view for include:

- Updating the credit card used to pay for Particle platform features
- Viewing SIM card data usage, and managing the connectivity state of
the SIM card
- View product billing and usage information, device fleet size, and current plan

<img src="{{assets}}/images/console/billing-view.png"
class="full-width"/>

## Product Tools

For many using Particle, the end-goal is to move from a single prototype
to a professional deployment of thousands or millions of units in the
field. When you begin making this transition to managing a larger fleet
of devices, you'll find yourself asking questions like:

- _How many_ of my devices are online right now?
- _Which_ firmware version is running on each device?
- _Who_ of my customers are using their devices, and who isn't?
- _Who_ in my company has access to this fleet, and what information can they
access?

This is where creating a Particle product is vital to ensure scaling can
happen seamlessly and successfully.

Luckily, the Particle Console is designed to give you full visibility into the
state of your product fleet, and provide a centralized control panel to change how
devices are functioning. It allows you and a team to manage firmware running on your devices, collect and analyze product data, and manage team permissions from a single administrative interface.

The first step to get started is understanding the differences between your
personal devices and those added to a Product.

### Devices vs Product Devices

Up until now, you've been an individual user of Particle. Your devices belong to
you, and you can only act upon one device at a time.

When you create a **Product**, you'll have a few additional important concepts available to you: **devices**, **team members** and **customers**.

First, you'll set up a **Product**, the overarching group responsible for the
development of your Internet of Things products.

Defining a Product is what unifies a group of homogeneous devices together, and your Product can be configured to function exactly how you
envision.

Each Product has its own fleet of associated **devices**. Any hardware
on the Particle Device Cloud including the PØ, P1,
Photon, and Electron, could be used inside a Product, but it's important to note that only one type of device will be in each Product

**Customers** own a device, and have permissions to control
their device. You will define the extent of their access to the device when you
configure your Product.

Your Product also has **team members** with access to the Console.

It is important to note that *team members* and *customers* have different levels of access. For instance, only *team members* will typically be able to send an over-the-air firmware update, while *customers* may have the ability to control their own product. These access levels will be controlled through the Console.

### Defining a product

Our cloud platform thinks that all devices are *Photons*, *Electrons*, or *Cores* — unless it's told otherwise. Now's the time to define your own product within the platform and tell us a bit about how that product should behave.

*Photons* are development kits. They're designed to be easy to reprogram and run a variety of software applications that you, our users, develop.

*Your product* is (probably) not a development kit. While some of the characteristics of the development kits will carry over, you're going to want to make a bunch of changes to how your product works. These include:

- Limiting access (e.g. only certain people can reprogram them)
- Collecting bulk data, events, errors, and logs from all of your devices
- Distributing firmware updates in a controlled fashion

To create a product, return to your personal console page and click on the **New Product** button.

![Your product page](/assets/images/products-page.png)

This will open up a modal where you can add basic details about your product:

![A new product](/assets/images/new-product-modal.png)

You now have your very first Particle product! Woot!

### Adding team members

Now that you have created a Product successfully, it's time to add your coworkers and friends that are collaborating with you on your IoT product. Adding a team member will give them full access to your Product's Console.

To do this, click on the *team icon* (<i class="ion-person-stalker"></i>) on the sidebar of your Product Console. This will direct you to the team page, where you can view and manage team members. Right now, your username should be the only one listed as a member of the Product. To add a new team member, just click the *Invite team member* button pictured below:

![Team page](/assets/images/team-page.png)

Clicking this button will open up a modal where you can invite a team member by email address. Before inviting a new team member, **make sure that they already have a Particle account with the email address you will be using to invite them to the Product**. 

![Invite team member](/assets/images/invite-team-member.png)
<p class="caption">The invite team member modal</p>

Once your team member is successfully invited, they will receive an email notifying them of their invitation. The next time they log into their Console, they will have the option of accepting or declining the invitation. Remember that you can have up to 5 team members in the free Prototype tier, so go send some invites!

Nice! Now you have a Product with a team.

### Your Product ID

When you created your product, a unique numeric ID was assigned to it. This small piece of information is *very, very important* to you as a product creator, and it will be used countless times during the development and manufacturing process for your product. You will be able to find your product's ID at any time in the navigation bar when viewing information about your product:

![A new product](/assets/images/product-id.png)
<p class="caption">Your product ID is marked with a key icon</p>

This ID will be used by the Particle Device Cloud to identify which devices belong to your Product, and subsequently it is part of what empowers you to manage firmware running on those devices *en masse*.

When working with devices that belong to your Product, it is important to note that this product ID must be compiled into the firmware that is running on each device. The product ID that the device reports to the cloud from its firmware will determine which Product it requests to become a part of. This will be covered more in-depth in the [rollout firmware](#rollout-firmware) section below.

### Adding Devices

Now that you have your Product, it's time to import devices. Importing devices will assign them to your Product and allow you to start viewing and managing these devices within your Product Console.

For any product you may be developing, you likely have one or more Particle development kits (i.e. a Photon) that you have been using internally for prototyping purposes. We strongly recommend importing these devices into your Product, and using them as your *development group*.

In addition, you'll want to have a *test group* of devices to serve as the guinea pigs for new versions of product firmware. You should get into the habit of uploading a new version of firmware to your product, and flashing it to your test group to ensure your code is working as expected. This too will be covered more in-depth in the [rollout firmware](#rollout-firmware) section below.

To import devices, click on the Devices icon in your product sidebar, then click on the "Import" button.

![Your product's devices](/assets/images/devices-page.png)

To allow you to import devices in bulk, we allow you to upload a file containing multiple device IDs. Create a `.txt` file that contains all of the IDs of devices that you would like to import into your product, one on each line. [Not sure what your device ID is?](/photon/cli/#running-from-source-advanced-particle-identify) *You cannot register devices that have already been 'claimed' by someone outside of your team; all of these devices must either belong to a team member or belong to no one*. The file should look something like this:

```
55ff6d04498b49XXXXXXXXXX
45f96d06492949XXXXXXXXXX
35ee6d064989a9XXXXXXXXXX
```

Where each line is one Device ID. Once you have your file ready, drop it onto the file selector in the import devices dialog box.

![Import devices modal](/assets/images/import-devices.png)

As noted at the bottom of the dialog box, if you previously rolled out
firmware, those newly imported devices will be updated over the air to
that firmware next time they connect to the Particle Device Cloud.

### Rollout Firmware

One of the most valuable features of a Particle product is being able
to seamlessly manage firmware on a fleet of IoT devices. You now have
the ability to continuously improve how a device functions after
deployment. In addition, product firmware management allows you to
quickly and remotely fix bugs identified in the field, fleet-wide.

This happens through **firmware releases**, which targets some or all of
a device fleet to automatically download and run a firmware binary.

#### Recommended development flow

When releasing firmware your fleet, it's helpful to first understand
Particle's recommended release flow. This flow has been designed to minimize
risk when deploying new firmware to devices:

<img src="/assets/images/release-firmware-flow.png" class="full-width" />
<p class="caption">The recommended flow for releasing firmware</p>

1. The first step of the release flow is using [**development
devices**](/guide/how-to-build-a-product/development-devices/) to rapidly develop and iterate on product firmware. These are special
product devices marked specifically for internal testing.
This gives you the flexibility to experiment with
new firmwares while still simulating behaviors of deployed devices in
the production fleet. For information on marking a device as a
development devices, check out [the
guide](/guide/how-to-build-a-product/development-devices/#marking-a-development-device).

2. When you have finalized a firmware that you feel confident in releasing
to your fleet, [**prepare the binary and upload it to your
product**](#preparing-a-binary).

3. Before releasing, you will need to ensure that the uploaded product
firmware is running on at least one device in your product fleet.
Your development device(s) may already be running the firmware,
but we also recommend [**locking one or more devices**](#locking-firmware)
to the newly updated firmware and ensure that it re-connects
successfully to the cloud. This is because locking more closely
represents a release action, with the specific firmware being delivered
to a product device.

4. [**Mark the firmware as released**](#releasing-firmware). This will
target product devices to automatically download and run the firmware.
The Particle Device Cloud will respect the [precedence
rules](#firmware-precedence-rules) to determine which firmware is
delivered to a given device. If you are on the Enterprise plan with
access to [device groups](/guide/how-to-build-a-product/device-groups/),
you can more safely roll out the firmware by targeting a subset of the
fleet for release.

The rest of this section contains details around how to go through this
process.

#### Development devices

Please visit the [guide on development
devices](/guide/how-to-build-a-product/development-devices/) for
information on this feature.

#### Preparing a binary

Click the Firmware icon in the left sidebar to get started. This will direct you to your product's firmware page, your centralized hub for viewing and managing firmware for your product's devices. If you haven't yet uploaded any firmware for this Product, your page will look like this:

<img src="/assets/images/firmware-page.png" class="full-width"
alt="Firmware page"/>

If you have been using the [Web IDE](/tutorials/developer-tools/build) to
develop firmware, you are used to the process of writing, compiling, and
then flashing firmware. You will follow the same high-level process
here, but altered slightly to work with a fleet of devices. The first thing you'll need to do is compile a *firmware binary* that you will upload to your Console.

Unlike compiling a binary for a single device, it is critical that the **product ID** and a **firmware version** are included in the compiled binary. Specifically, you must add `PRODUCT_ID([your product ID])` and `PRODUCT_VERSION([version])` into the application code of your firmware. This is documented fully [here](https://github.com/particle-iot/device-os/blob/develop/docs/build.md#product-id).

Add these two "macros" near the top of your main application `.ino`
file, below `#include "Particle.h"` if it includes that line. Remember
that your [product ID](#your-product-id) can be found in the navigation
of your Console. The firmware version must be an integer that increments
each time a new binary is uploaded to the Console. This allows the
Particle Device Cloud to determine which devices should be running which firmwares.

Here is an example of Blinky with the correct product and version details:

```
PRODUCT_ID(94);
PRODUCT_VERSION(1);

int led = D0;  // You'll need to wire an LED to this one to see it blink.

void setup() {
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(led, HIGH);   // Turn ON the LED pins
  delay(300);               // Wait for 1000mS = 1 second
  digitalWrite(led, LOW);    // Turn OFF the LED pins
  delay(300);               // Wait for 1 second in off mode
}
```

#### Compiling Binaries

If you are in the Web IDE, you can easily download a compiled binary by
clicking the code icon (<i class="ion-code"></i>) in your sidebar. You
will see the name of your app in the pane, along with a download icon
(shown below). Click the download icon to compile and download your current binary.

![Compile firmware](/assets/images/ide-compile.png)
<p class="caption">Compile and download a product binary from the web IDE</p>

If you are using the [Desktop IDE](/guide/tools-and-features/dev/), clicking on the compile icon (<i class="ion-checkmark-circled"></i>) will automatically add a `.bin` file to your current working directory if the compilation is a success. **Note**: Make sure that you have a device selected in Particle Dev before compiling.

![Compile firmware](/assets/images/particle-dev-icon.png)
<p class="caption">Particle Dev will automatically add a compiled binary to your working directory after you compile</p>

Once you have a binary ready to go, it's time to upload it to the Console!

#### Uploading firmware

Back on the firmware page, click on the **Upload** button in the top-right corner of the page. This will launch the upload firmware modal:

![Upload firmware](/assets/images/upload-firmware.png)

A few things to keep in mind here:

* The firmware version that you enter into this screen **must match** what you just compiled into your binary. Madness will ensue otherwise!
* You should give your firmware a distinct title that concisely describes how it differs from other versions of firmware. This name will be important in how firmware is rolled out to devices
* Attach your newly compiled `.bin` file in the gray box

Click upload. Congrats! You've uploaded your first version of product firmware! You should now see it appear in your list of firmware versions.

![Product firmware version](/assets/images/product-firmware.png)
<p class="caption">Your firmware version now appears in your list of available binaries</p>

#### Releasing firmware

Time to flash that shiny new binary to some devices! Notice that when
you hover over a version of firmware, you have the ability to
**release firmware**. Releasing firmware is the mechanism by which any
number of devices can receive a single version of firmware
without being individually targeted.

Imagine identifying a bug in your firmware and pushing out a fix to
thousands of devices that are out in the field. Or, consider the
possibility of continuing to add new capabilities to your fleet connected
devices, even after being deployed. It is all possible via releasing
firmware.

As a product creator, you can choose to release firmware to *some* or *all* of your
product fleet. Releasing a firmware as the **product default** sets the
firmware as the default version available to *all*
devices in the fleet to download and run.

To start the release process, place your cursor over the firmware you
want to release and click **Release firmware**:

<img class="full-width" src="/assets/images/release-firmware-list.png" />

A modal will appear, asking you to confirm the action you are about to
take:

![Release firmware confirmation](/assets/images/release-firmware-confirmation.png)
<p class="caption">Always confirm the version, targeted group(s) and impacted devices
before releasing firmware to your device fleet to ensure you are taking
the desired action.</p>

*Impacted devices* refers specifically to the number of devices
that will receive an OTA firmware update as a direct result of this
action. Keep in mind  that releasing firmware always presents risk. Anytime the code on a
device is changed, there is a chance of introducing bugs or regressions.
As a safeguard, **a firmware version must be successfully running on at
least one device before it can be released**.

When you have confirmed the release is what you have intended, click the
**Release this firmware** button. Note that the devices will not receive the firmware immediately;
instead, they will be targeted for an over-the-air update the next time
they start a new secure session with the cloud (this is called a
*handshake*).

It is also possible to release firmware to a subset of your product
fleet, using [device
groups](/guide/how-to-build-a-product/device-groups/). For more
information on fine-grained firmware management, please check out
[the guide](/guide/how-to-build-a-product/device-groups) on device
groups. Note that this is a feature currently only available to
enterprise customers. Please [contact us](https://particle.io/sales) for
access to this feature.

#### Locking firmware

In many cases, you may want to force a device to download and run a specific
version of product firmware. This is referred to as **locking** the
device. You can lock a device to a new version of product
firmware to test it before releasing the firmware to the fleet.

To lock a device to a firmware, find the device on your product's
devices view <i class="im-devices-icon"></i>. Click on the device, which
will take you to the device details view. Click on the **Edit** button:

<img class="full-width" alt="Edit device" src="/assets/images/edit-device.png" />

This will allow you to edit many aspects of the device's state,
including the firmware it is targeted to run. Find the **Firmware**
section, select a version of firmware you want to lock the device to,
and click the **Lock** button as sown below:

<img class="full-width" alt="Lock device firmware"
src="/assets/images/lock-firmware.png" />

If the device is currently online, you can optionally immediately
trigger an OTA update to the device by checking *Flash now* next to the
lock button. Otherwise, the device will download and run the locked
firmware the next time it handshakes with the cloud (starts a new secure
session, most often on reset).

Once the device downloads and runs the locked firmware, it will no
longer be targeted by the Particle cloud for automatic firmware updates,
until it is unlocked. For more details, please read the [firmware
precedence rules](#firmware-precedence-rules).

#### Unlocking firmware

Unlocking a product device breaks its association with the locked
firmware version and makes the device eligible to receive released
product firmwares once again.

To unlock a device, visit the device's details view by clicking on it
from your product's device list. Click the **Edit button** (shown
above), and then click the **Unlock** button:

<img class="full-width" alt="Unlock device firmware"
src="/assets/images/unlock-firmware.png" />

The device above is now unlocked from version 3 of product firmware, and
may be targeted to receive a released firmware next time it handshakes
with the cloud.

#### Firmware Precedence Rules

Devices in your fleet will be targeted to
receive a version of product firmware according to these precedence
rules:

- A device that has been **individually locked** to a version of product
firmware is respected above all else, and will not be overwritten by any
released firmwares.

- If unlocked, devices **belonging to a group** will receive the
corresponding group's released firmware (if a firmware has been released
to the group). When a device belongs to multiple groups that each have
released firmware, the _highest firmware version_ will be preferred

- If a device is unlocked and **does not belong to any groups** with
released firmware, it will receive the **Product default** released
firmware (if a firmware has been released as the Product default)

- If none of the above conditions result in a device being targeted for
a product firmware, it will not receive an automatic OTA update from the
Particle cloud

### Managing Customers

Now that you have set up a Product, your customers will be able to create accounts on the Particle platform that are registered to your Product. When properly implemented, your customers will have no idea that Particle is behind the scenes; they will feel like they are creating an account with *ACME, Inc.*.

There are three ways you can authenticate your customers:

- **Simple authentication**. Your customers will create an account with Particle that is registered to your product. You do not need to set up your own authentication system, and will hit the Particle API directly.
- **Two-legged authentication**. Your customers will create an account on your servers using your own authentication system, and your web servers will create an account with Particle for each customer that is paired to that customer. Your servers will request a scoped access token for each customer to interact with their device. This is a completely white-labeled solution.
- **Login with Particle**. Your customers will create a Particle account and a separate account on your website, and link the two together using OAuth 2.0. Unlike the other authentication options, this option will showcase Particle branding. This is most useful when the customer is aware of Particle and may be using Particle's development tools with the product.

When you create your Product in the Console, you will be asked which authentication method you want to use. Implementation of these methods are covered in detail in the [How to build a web app](/guide/how-to-build-a-product/web-app/) section of this guide.

As customers are created for your product, they will begin to appear on your Customers (<i class="ion-user"></i>) page. For each customer, you will be able to see their username and associated device ID. Note that the device ID column will not be populated until the customer goes through the claiming process with their device.

### Monitoring Event Logs

The Logs page (<i class="icon-terminal"></i>) is also available to product creators! Featuring the same interface as what you are used to with the [developer version of the Console](/guide/tools-and-features/console/), the logs will now include events from any device identifying as your product. Use this page to get a real-time look into what is happening with your devices. In order to take full advantage of the Logs page, be sure to use `Particle.publish()` in your firmware.

### Managing your billing

To see all billing related information, you can click on the billing icon in your Product's sidebar (<i class="ion-card"></i>). This is the hub for all billing-related information and actions. For more specifics about the pricing tiers and frequently asked questions, [go check out the Pricing page](https://www.particle.io/pricing).

### How billing works

#### Product owners 
Each Product has one primary administrator, the product owner. The owner manages the payment options, the pricing tier, and what billing interval the Product is on. This owner is the account that created the Product in the first place. 

#### Devices

Devices are any physical device that uses the Particle Device Cloud- Photons, Electrons, P1s, P0s, etc. The only devices that count toward your pricing tier are those in a single Product fleet, so you could have many “loose” devices in your personal account without them adding to the number of devices in one of your Products. 

Your personal account’s devices (as well as new, unclaimed devices) are added to a Product when you want to use them as a group for data reporting, firmware updates, and collaboration with coworkers or friends. Only when they’ve been intentionally added to a Product will they count towards that total. 

#### Billing periods 
Products in the Console are billed separately, so if you have more than one they can be on different pricing tiers and have different billing dates. The billing date for a Product is the anniversary of when it was first created, either day of the month if you’re on a monthly plan or the day of the year (month+day) in the case of an annually paid plan.

All Console plans are billed at the beginning of the plan period; in other words, it’s prepaid. You’ll pay for the following month or year, and can later cancel for a prorated remainder. 

### Status
It’s easy to find out the status of your Product’s metrics. Visit [console.particle.io/billing](https://console.particle.io/billing) and you’ll see an up-to-date list of each Product you own, how many outbound events they’ve used that billing cycle, number of devices in each, and how many team members they have. The renewal date for each Product plan is also shown, so you know when the next bill is coming up.

### Changing Plans 

The self-service plan covers up to 250 devices in your product. For larger numbers of devices, service-level agreements (SLAs), and priority support you should [contact sales](https://particle.io/sales/).

### Updating your credit card

You can update your credit card from the billing page by clicking on the "UPDATE" button next to the credit card on file. Whenever your credit card on file expires or no longer is valid, be sure to update your credit card info here to avoid any disruptions in your service.

### Failed Payments

If we attempt to charge your credit card and it fails, we do not immediately prevent you or your team from accessing your Device Management Console. We will continue to retry charging your card once every few days <strong>for a maximum of 3 retries</strong>. You will receive an email notification each time an attempt is made and fails. When you receive this notification, the best thing to avoid any interruption in service is to <a href="#updating-your-credit-card">update your credit card</a>.

### Configuring Your Product

As a product creator, there are some key decisions you will need to make before devices are shipped to customers. Your configuration page will walk you through key questions that you should be thinking about during the development process. **You don't need to know the answers to all of these questions right now.** You are always able to return to your Configuration page to answer outstanding questions, or change your answers. However, you **should** answer all questions before you can start manufacturing.

It's also worth mentioning that some of the questions asked on the configuration page have tangible impacts on how your product will function within the Particle ecosystem, and others are simply educational to encourage you to be thinking strategically about what needs to happen before your product goes to manufacturing.

There are four main sections to the configuration page: *Overview*, *Working with Particle*, *Customers*, and *Firmware*. A few questions to highlight here:

* **Authentication/Logging in with Particle**: Thinking about how you would like to handle authentication is one of the earlier decisions you should be make as a product creator. There are three options for authentication: *simple auth*, *two-legged auth*, and *login with Particle (OAuth)*. Each option is explained in detail [later](#managing-customers). Picking an authentication method will likely depend on whether/how much you would like Particle to be hidden from your customers, as well as your development's team appetite for complexity.

* **Private Beta**: Do you only want a select group of people to use your product, inviting them as part of a private beta? This is likely a good idea if you would like to run a controlled test for your product. As a manager of a private beta, you will import a list of customers you would like to participate, and each one will be assigned a 4-character activation code that they will need to claim their device during setup.

* **Programming the product during manufacturing**: You can either program each device while they are on the manufacturing line, or send an OTA update to the device on customer setup. The main advantage of programming on the line is that the device will function immediately, instead of requiring the customer to be in range of Wi-Fi when they unbox the device. However, programming on the line will require your binary to be locked down and finalized before manufacturing begins. Programming the device on setup will allow you to continue developing the firmware for your product in between manufacturing and customer unboxing, providing additional flexibility. But, the device will not function properly until the customer connects the device to the internet and receives the OTA.
