# USB Serial Debugging

While Particle Devices typically communicate using the Particle Cloud and the Internet,
for debugging code and troubleshooting, it's often common to use a USB connection to your 
computer or laptop. It's also possible to update your user firmware and Device OS over USB. 

It's not possible for devices to communicate with the Internet over USB; they must
use the network type they are designed for, such as Wi-Fi or cellular.

Particle devices are a USB device, intended to connect to a computer.
They cannot be used as a USB host, so you cannot plug a USB keyboard into a Photon
or Argon, for example. You also cannot connect something like a USB RS232 adapter, though 
they are other, easier ways to add serial ports. 

You generally cannot connect your phone to a Particle device by USB. The normal method 
of communicating with a mobile app is over the Internet through the Particle cloud. 
Gen 3 Particle devices can connect by Bluetooth LE (BLE) to your phone. Gen 2 Wi-Fi 
devices (Photon, P1) have a limited ability to communicate directly over Wi-Fi for 
device setup. 

Some Android phones can plug directly into a Particle device by USB
by using a USB OTG ("on the go") adapter, which allows your phone to behave mostly
like a USB host, even though it's normally a USB device. Apple iOS (iPhone and iPad)
devices do not support USB OTG.

## Using a terminal program

### Particle CLI 

A common way to view debug serial messages is the [Particle CLI](/tutorials/developer-tools/cli/). Note that the CLI only reads serial messages, it is strictly a serial monitor, and you can't type things to the Photon/Electron. Still, it's quick and easy, and very handy.

```
$ particle serial monitor
Opening serial monitor for com port: "/dev/cu.usbmodemFD1161"
```

On Windows, open a Command Prompt window to use the `particle serial monitor` command. For Mac or Linux, open a Terminal window.

One particularly useful command line option is the `--follow` option which will reconnect to the Particle
device if it disconnects. This is helpful because if the device resets (including after a firmware update) 
USB serial is briefly disconnected. To stop reconnecting, press Ctrl-C.

```
particle serial monitor --follow
```

The Windows Command Prompt has an unusual method of copying to the clipboard:

- Press Ctrl-M ("mark"). It's also available if you click on the icon in the upper left corner of the window in the Edit menu.
- Drag a selection around the text you want to copy.
- Press Enter to Copy to the clipboard (also in the Edit menu).

### Particle Workbench

In Particle Workbench (VS Code), open the command palette (Command-Shift-P on the Mac, Ctrl-Shift-P on Windows and Linux) and select **Particle: Serial Monitor**.


### Windows

For Windows, you can also use a program like [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) or [CoolTerm](http://freeware.the-meiers.org).

It's hard to say what COM port your Photon or Electron will use, but if you open the Windows **Device Manager** and expand **Ports (COM & LPT)** it should show the device.

![Device Manager](/assets/images/serial-faq-03devicemanager.png)

This is the configuration screen for PuTTY:

![PuTTY](/assets/images/serial-faq-04putty.png)

Click **Serial** (1) then enter the COM port number (2) then click **Open** (3).


### Mac

Find the serial port that is being used using the Terminal program command line:

```
ls /dev/cu.usb*
```

It should return something like `/dev/cu.usbmodemFD1161`.

Then issue the command:

```
screen /dev/cu.usbmodemFD1161
```

Screen allows you you both send characters to the Photon or Electron as well as receive them from the USB serial device.

To close (kill) a screen session, press Ctrl-A then press k. 

### Linux

Find the serial port that is being used using the Terminal program command line:

```
ls /dev/ttyACM*
```

It should return something like `/dev/ttyACM0`.

Then issue the command:

```
screen /dev/ttyACM0
```

Screen allows you you both send characters to the Photon or Electron as well as receive them from the USB serial device.

To close (kill) a screen session, press Ctrl-A then press k. 

### Web serial

If you are using the Chrome web browser (version 89 or higher) on Windows, Mac, Linux, or
Chromebook, you can use the web-based USB serial monitor. 

This is particularly useful if you have a Chromebook, or cannot install additional software 
on your computer.

The button below will open a new tab, as you will probably want to be able to use other 
things like the Web IDE and documentation at the same time.

## User firmware

Here's simple firmware you can flash to your device to test USB serial output:

{{> sso}}
{{> codebox content="/assets/files/UsbSerialSimple.cpp" format="cpp" height="300" flash="true"}}

#### In depth

```cpp
#include "Particle.h"
```

This line is only required for .cpp files, not for .ino files. Since it doesn't hurt and is
sometimes required, it's easy to just always add it.


```cpp
SerialLogHandler logHandler;
```

This line sets up the serial log handler. This is the the preferred way to output serial
debug logs. You can [learn more here](/cards/firmware/debugging/serial-print-vs-log-info/).

- Using the log handler you can adjust the verbosity from a single statement in your code, including setting the logging level per module at different levels.
- Using the log handler you can redirect the logs between USB serial and UART serial with one line of code.
- Other logging handlers allow you to store logs on SD cards, to a network service like syslog, or to a cloud-based service like Solarwinds Papertrail.

Being able to switch from USB to UART serial is especially helpful if you are using sleep modes. Because USB serial disconnects on sleep, it can take several seconds for it to reconnect to your computer. By using UART serial (Serial1, for example) with a USB to TTL serial converter, the USB serial will stay connected to the adapter so you can begin logging immediately upon wake.

```cpp
SYSTEM_THREAD(ENABLED);
```

This line enables system threaded mode. It allows your code to run before connected 
to the cloud, such as when blinking green or cyan. 
You can [learn more here](/cards/firmware/system-thread/system-thread/).

```cpp
const std::chrono::milliseconds logPeriod = 5s;
unsigned long lastLog;
int counter;
```

These lines are part of the code that periodically prints output. The first line is how
often to generate messages. In this case, 5 seconds (`5s`). You could change this to 
`10s` (10 seconds), `500ms` (500 milliseconds), or `1min` (1 minute).

```cpp
void setup() {
}
```

There's nothing to set up here. Sometimes you'll see `Serial.begin()` here, but it's not
necessary if you are using `SerialLogHandler`.

```cpp
void loop() {
    if (Network.listening()) {
        return;
    }
```

This is not always necessary, but one thing to beware of: When using system thread mode,
your code also runs when in listening mode (blinking dark blue). 

If you are continuously writing to the USB
serial port from your code, you can prevent listening mode (blinking dark blue) from
working properly. This will affect commands like `particle identify`. 
Avoiding output when in listening mode allows these commands to work properly.

```cpp
    if (millis() - lastLog >= logPeriod.count()) {
        lastLog = millis();
```

This code handled executing the inner part of the `if` at a predefined interval
set in `logPeriod` above. The default is every 5 seconds (`5s`) but you can change 
the code to other values. 


```cpp
        Log.info("counter=%d", ++counter);
    }
}
```

And finally, this outputs a message.

If you are monitoring the serial output, you should see something like this:

```
0000010001 [app] INFO: counter=2
0000015001 [app] INFO: counter=3
0000020001 [app] INFO: counter=4
0000025001 [app] INFO: counter=5
```

The leftmost column is a timestamp in milliseconds. 

The second column is what module 
generated the message. You might also see `[system]` or `[comm.protocol]` here.

The third column is the log level. What do you think would happen if you changed
the code to be:

```cpp
Log.error("counter=%d", ++counter);
```

Other logging methods can be [found here](/cards/firmware/logging/logging/).

## More examples

The example above uses this code:

```cpp
Log.info("counter=%d", ++counter);
```

There's actually a lot going on here.

- `Log.info` can also be `Log.error`, `Log.warn` or `Log.trace` depending on the 
severity of the message. 
- `"counter=%d"` is a `sprintf` formatting string.
- `++counter` are the variable arguments to `sprintf`. In this case, the global variable
`counter` is incremented on every use.

`Log.trace` is not printed by default, so that's good choice for more detailed debugging.
See [Customizing log levels](#customizing-log-levels), below, for more information.


Here are some more examples of logging statements and their expected output:

```cpp
Log.info("staring test millis=%lu", millis());
// 0000068727 [app] INFO: staring test millis=68727

// To print an int as decimal, use %d
Log.info("counter=%d", ++counter);
// 0000068728 [app] INFO: counter=1

// To print an int as hexadecimal, use %x
int value1 = 1234;
Log.info("value1=%d value1=%x (hex)", value1, value1);
// 0000068728 [app] INFO: value1=1234 value1=4d2 (hex)

// To print a string, use %s
const char *testStr1 = "testing 1, 2, 3";
Log.info("value1=%d testStr=%s", value1, testStr1);
// 0000068728 [app] INFO: value1=1234 testStr=testing 1, 2, 3

// To print a long integer, use %ld, %lx, etc.
long value2 = 123456789;
Log.info("value2=%ld value2=%lx (hex)", value2, value2);
// 0000068729 [app] INFO: value2=123456789 value2=75bcd15 (hex)

// To print to a fixed number of places with leading zeros:
Log.info("value2=%08lx (hex, 8 digits, with leading zeros)", value2);
// 0000068729 [app] INFO: value2=075bcd15 (hex, 8 digits, with leading zeros)

// To print an unsigned long integer (uint32_t), use %lu or %lx
uint32_t value3 = 0xaabbccdd;
Log.info("value3=%lu value3=%lx (hex)", value3, value3);
// 0000068730 [app] INFO: value3=2864434397 value3=aabbccdd (hex)

// To print a floating point number, use %f
float value4 = 1234.5;
Log.info("value4=%f", value4);
// 0000068730 [app] INFO: value4=1234.500000

// To print a double floating point, use %lf
double value5 = 1234.333;
Log.info("value5=%lf", value5);
//  0000068731 [app] INFO: value5=1234.333000

// To limit the number of decimal places:
Log.info("value5=%.2lf (to two decimal places)", value5);
// 0000068732 [app] INFO: value5=1234.33 (to two decimal places)
```

Any time you are printing a `String` object from `Log.info` you must do it like this:

```cpp
String myString = "testing!";
Log.info("message: %s", myString.c_str());

// Print my local IP address (Photon, P1, and Argon):
Log.info("ip address: %s", WiFi.localIP().toString().c_str());
```

- Note the use of `%s` for a string
- You must add the `.c_str()` at the end, otherwise it will print garbage characters!

The reason is that with variable arguments, the compiler does not know you want the
c-string version (null terminated, compatible with `%s`). You can also do it this way
if you prefer:

```cpp
Log.info("ip address: %s", (const char *) WiFi.localIP().toString();
```

If you want to log a MAC address (hardware address, used with Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and BLE), you can
print the normal hex format by using:

```
uint8_t addr[6];
Ethernet.macAddress(addr);

Log.info("mac: %02x-%02x-%02x-%02x-%02x-%02x", 
    addr[0], addr[1], addr[2], addr[3], addr[4], addr[5]);
```

Sprintf-style formatting, including `Log.info()` etc. does not support 64-bit integers. It does not support `%lld`, `%llu` or Microsoft-style `%I64d` or `%I64u`. As a workaround you can use the `Print64` firmware library in the community libraries. The source and instructions can be found [in GitHub](https://github.com/rickkas7/Print64/). This can happen if you want to print the event code for a [System Event Handler](/cards/firmware/system-events/system-events/) which is type `system_event_t` which is 64-bits wide.

You can learn more about `sprintf` [here](/cards/firmware/other-functions/sprintf/).

These messages are limited to 200 characters and are truncated if longer. 

If you want to use write longer data, you can use `Log.print(str)` which takes a pointer to a null-terminated c-string. Note that the output does not include the timestamp, category, and level, so you may want to precede it with `Log.info()`, etc. but is not length-limited. You cannot use printf-style formatting with `Log.print()`.

You can also print data in hexadecimal using `Log.dump(ptr, len)` to print a buffer in hex as specified by pointer and length. It also does not include the timestamp, category, and level.


## Two-way USB serial

Often you will only use USB serial to output message from your program. In fact, the 
`particle serial monitor` is really only a monitor and you cannot type back to the device.

{{> codebox content="/assets/files/UsbSerialTwoWay.cpp" format="cpp" height="300" flash="true"}}

Sometimes you will want to interact with your program, and it is possible to do two-way
communication using programs like `screen` (Mac or Linux) or PuTTY and CoolTerm (Windows).
You can also use the Arduino IDE as a two-way serial program.

It will print messages received in the USB serial debug output like this:

```
0000190001 [app] INFO: counter=38
0000195001 [app] INFO: counter=39
0000195304 [app] INFO: received Testing!
0000200001 [app] INFO: counter=40
```

## Customizing log levels

In the example above we used this statement:

```cpp
SerialLogHandler logHandler;
```

A common variation is to specify the level:

```cpp
SerialLogHandler logHandler(LOG_LEVEL_TRACE);
```

- Setting the level to `LOG_LEVEL_TRACE` includes all `Log.trace`, `Log.info`, `Log.warn`, and `Log.error`.

- The default if you do not specify is `LOG_LEVEL_INFO`.

| Level |
| :---: |
| `LOG_LEVEL_TRACE` |
| `LOG_LEVEL_INFO` |
| `LOG_LEVEL_WARN` |
| `LOG_LEVEL_ERROR` | 

The Tracker Edge firmware includes this:

```cpp
SerialLogHandler logHandler(115200, LOG_LEVEL_TRACE, {
    { "app.gps.nmea", LOG_LEVEL_INFO },
    { "app.gps.ubx",  LOG_LEVEL_INFO },
    { "ncp.at", LOG_LEVEL_INFO },
    { "net.ppp.client", LOG_LEVEL_INFO },
});
```

- The 115200 is optional, as the baud rate is ignored. It's there so you can change it to be a 
`Serial1LogHandler` with a 1-character change and have it work with hardware UART serial.
- It sets the default log level to `LOG_LEVEL_TRACE`.
- For the category "app.gps.nmea" (the GPS library), it sets the level to `LOG_LEVEL_INFO` as 
the logs are too verbose at `LOG_LEVEL_TRACE` unless you are debugging a GPS issue.
- Same for the other categories, feel free to add more.

You may also want to go the other way, and set the default to `LOG_LEVEL_INFO` and increase
it for specific modules you want detailed debugging on.

```cpp
SerialLogHandler logHandler(115200, LOG_LEVEL_INFO, {
    { "app.mymodule", LOG_LEVEL_TRACE },
});
```


## UART serial

The USB serial debug is great, but there are a few cases where it's less convenient.
One is when using sleep modes. When the Particle devices goes to sleep, USB is disconnected.
When you wake up, it can take a while (a few seconds on Mac or Linux, as many as 8 seconds 
on Windows) to reconnect. 

One solution to this is to use UART serial, hardware serial, for example `Serial1` on the 
`TX` and `RX` pins, if you are not already using it in your project. 

You'll need a converter:

### Converters

There are a number of USB to TTL serial converters available. [This one from Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12731)
works well with Particle devices; it's fully compatible and has a micro-USB connector like the Photon, Electron, Argon, and Boron. 
It works without additional drivers on Mac and Linux and there are drivers available for Windows.

There are many other options, however:

- Make sure your converter is a 3.3V TTL serial converter.
- Absolutely not an RS232 converter - that will permanently damage your Particle device!
- `FT232` is a good search term. It's the name of FTDI chip in many of these converters.
- There are other chipsets like the CH340 that also work fine.

A 5V TTL converter will probably work Particle Device TX to converter RX, but never connect
a 5V TX to an Argon or Boron RX pin! Gen 3 Particle devices are not 5V tolerant. Using a 3.3V serial 
converter is a safer option.

#### Particle Debugger

The Particle Debugger is also a 3.3V TTL serial converter!

- The 10-pin ribbon cable does not connect TX and RX.
- Connect `TX` on the Photon, Electron, Argon, Boron, etc. to `RX` on the Particle Debugger.
- Optionally connect `RX` on the Particle device to `TX` on the Particle Debugger if you need two-way communication.
- Make sure you match the baud rates.


#### Otii Arc

The [Qoitech Otii Arc](https://www.qoitech.com/otii/) is a programmable power supply that is
great for testing power consumption on Particle devices. 

An additional benefit is that is has an available TTL serial connection. You can connect the
`TX` output of the Particle device to `RX` on the Arc, and it will correlate the time of the
serial output with the power consumption!

### User firmware

In your user firmware, you'll need to enable `Serial1` output. For example:

```cpp
Serial1LogHandler uartLogHandler(115200);
```

Make sure you match the baud rate! Another common setting is 9600:

```cpp
Serial1LogHandler uartLogHandler(9600);
```

You can enable both USB and UART serial output at the same time:

```cpp
SerialLogHandler logHandler;
Serial1LogHandler uartLogHandler(115200);
```

You can also choose different log levels based on the destination logger:

```cpp
SerialLogHandler logHandler(LOG_LEVEL_INFO);
Serial1LogHandler uartLogHandler(115200, LOG_LEVEL_TRACE);
```
