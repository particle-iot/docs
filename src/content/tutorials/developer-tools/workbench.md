## Workbench Features

### Welcome Screen

![Welcome Screen](/assets/images/workbench/welcome.png)

The Welcome Screen has handy tips for using Workbench. If you close it, you can get it back by clicking on the Particle icon in the left toolbar.

### Left Toolbar

Typically, there is a toolbar on the left with frequently used features.

| Button | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="/assets/images/workbench/left-bar-explorer.png" class="toolbarIcon" /> | File Explorer |
| <img src="/assets/images/workbench/left-bar-search.png" class="toolbarIcon" /> | Search and Replace |
| <img src="/assets/images/workbench/left-bar-source-control.png" class="toolbarIcon" /> | Source code control (like Git) |
| <img src="/assets/images/workbench/left-bar-debugger.png" class="toolbarIcon" /> | Source level debugger |
| <img src="/assets/images/workbench/left-bar-extensions.png" class="toolbarIcon" /> | Add or modify VS Code Extensions |
| <img src="/assets/images/workbench/left-bar-particle.png" class="toolbarIcon" /> | Particle Welcome Screen |


### Particle Commands

If you’re new to Visual Studio Code, the Command Palette will become a familiar part of the user interface. As the name implies, the Command Palette provides access to many commands such as open files, search for symbols, and see a quick outline of a file, all using the same interactive window. It can be invoked via `cmd+shift+p` on macOS or `ctrl+shift+p` on Linux and Windows.

Workbench adds custom Particle commands to the palette. Start typing `Particle` to see all the currently available commands.

![Command Palette](/assets/images/workbench/command-palette.png)

There is also a [command palette reference](#command-palette-reference) below.

### Dependency Manager

Downloading and maintaining a local toolchain can be a full-time job so Workbench introduces a new dependency manager. It downloads the Device OS, build system, compiler, and anything else needed to develop and debug Device OS apps, and places them in a local, private location in user space as to not mess with your current configuration.

You can install and uninstall different versions of Device OS (and dependencies) with **Particle: Install Local Compiler**. You can uninstall unneeded versions just as easily.

![Dependency Manager](/assets/images/workbench/dependency-manager.png)


### Working with Particle Projects

You can initialize a new project with the command, `Particle: Create New Project`. Doing so will open a new a Visual Studio Code folder preconfigured with everything needed to begin developing your Particle project, like Tasks, C++ IntelliSense, Commands, files and folders. Note that these are designed to only work when editing Particle projects as to not muddy up the rest of your editing experience.

A project contains a number of files. Here's what's in a small sample project:

![Project Directories](/assets/images/workbench/project-directories.png)

- The **`.vscode`** directory contains your project-specific settings. The `settings.json` file allows you to override any setting on a per-project basis. It's also where your build firmware version, target platform, and target device are saved.
- The **`src`** directory contains your source file. If you created a `.ino` file for your main project file, after building you may see a `.cpp` file of the same name. This is because the `.ino` file is transformed into a `.cpp` before compiling. You can create multiple source files and header files in this directory.
- Not pictured here is the **`lib`** directory, at the same level as `src`. This contains the source to libraries that you have included. If you are cloud compiling, _and_ if you have the library listed in your `project.properties` file, the cloud version of the library is used instead of the downloaded one in **`lib`**.
- The **`target`** directory contains local build output organized into subfolders based on the Device OS version and Particle platform your project uses. In particular, the `.bin` file (`Test1.bin`) is the same binary you get from downloading from the Web IDE or CLI.
- The **`*.bin`** file (your filename will be different) at the top level is the result of a cloud compile for this project.
- The **`project.properties`** file specifies all of the libraries that this project uses.
- **`README.md`** is where you could put documentation for your project.

If you already have an existing Particle project (with a `project.properties` file), you can import it to create the necessary VS Code files by using the command **Particle: Import Project** from the command palette.

### Cloud build and flash

Before you can build in the cloud (the way Particle Web IDE and Particle CLI normally build), you need to select the device you wish to build for.

From the Command Palette select **Particle: Configure Workspace for Device**.

![Configure Device](/assets/images/workbench/config-device-1.png)

Then the device OS version you'd like to build for:

![Configure Device](/assets/images/workbench/config-device-2.png)

Then the type of device to you'd like to build for:

![Configure Device](/assets/images/workbench/config-device-3.png)

And finally the name or device ID of the device you want to flash to. You can leave this blank if you're going to flash by USB, or just want to test building.

![Configure Device](/assets/images/workbench/config-device-4.png)

To compile your program and download the binary, open the Command Palette and select **Particle: Cloud Compile**. To compile your program in the cloud and flash it to the selected device over-the-air, select **Particle: Cloud Flash**. 

![Compile or Flash](/assets/images/workbench/compile-flash.png)

It's also possible to compile in the cloud and flash over USB, as described in the section [Cloud build and flash locally](#cloud-build-and-flash-locally), below.


### Local build and flash

Local build does all of the compiling locally on your computer, and, once installed, can be used even without an Internet connection.

In order to target a specific version of Device OS you must install the appropriate toolchain first. From the Command Palette select **Particle: Install Local Compiler**.

![Install Local Compiler](/assets/images/workbench/local-1.png)

Then select the version you want to install.

![Install Local Compiler Version](/assets/images/workbench/local-2.png)

To compile and flash locally, use the Command Palette and select one of the local flash options:

- Particle: Flash application (local)
- Particle: Flash application for debug (local)
- Particle: Flash application & Device OS (local)

![Flash Local](/assets/images/workbench/local-3.png)

In order to use the Flash options, the device must be connected by USB. The device will be placed into DFU mode (blinking yellow) automatically. If for some reason you need to enter DFU manually, you can do so by holding down the MODE (or SETUP) button while tapping RESET. Continue to hold down MODE (or SETUP) while the status LED blinks magenta (red and blue at the same time), until it blinks yellow, then release.

There are also compile options, which compile the code and download a binary:

- Particle: Compile application (local)
- Particle: Compile application for debug (local)
- Particle: Compile application & Device OS (local)

![Compile Local](/assets/images/workbench/local-4.png)

Normally, Device OS (system firmware) is built by Particle and downloaded to your device if an upgrade is needed. User applications are generally small and fast to update because the Device OS is not normally downloaded.

With Workbench local builds, you can optionally flash both Device OS and your binary using the **Flash application & Device OS** option in Build Tasks. This will upgrade or downgrade the Device OS. It also allows you to make a modified Device OS and flash it to your device by USB.

There is also a monolithic build. It contains both the Device OS and your user application in a single binary. Using the **for debug** options creates a monolithic debug build. These binaries are large, but are better suited for use with the debugger. Also, because the boundary between Device OS and the user application is removed, it's possible to call more low-level system functions from monolithic builds.

The local compile and flash options are also available in the Build Tasks palette (`cmd+shift+b` or `ctrl+shift+b`).

If you are getting mysterious errors, sometimes it's helpful to do a clean to remove old objects that might be causing difficulties:

- Particle: Clean application (local)
- Particle: Clean application & Device OS (local)
- Particle: Clean application for debug (local)

![Clean Local](/assets/images/workbench/local-5.png)

When switching from a debug build back to a non-debug build, be sure to use the **Particle: Flash application & Device OS (local)** option once. This will put the correct modular Device OS build back onto the device.

To increase the verbosity of the local compiler, set **Enable Verbose Local Compiler Logging** in the [Settings](#settings).

_NOTE: due to limitations with the local compiler's build system, usernames (or paths) with spaces cannot be supported at this time_

### Compile and Flash Buttons

When you are viewing a .cpp or .ino file, there will be two new icons in the upper right corner:

![Clean Local](/assets/images/workbench/compile-flash-button.png)

| Button | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="/assets/images/workbench/compile-button.png" class="toolbarIcon" /> | Compile |
| <img src="/assets/images/workbench/flash-button.png" class="toolbarIcon" /> | Compile and Flash |

By default, the **Compile** button invokes **Particle: Compile application & Device OS (local)**. Flash works similarly. To change to cloud compile and flash, see the [Settings](#settings) section.

### Integrated CLI

Workbench ships with a local copy of the Particle CLI (Command-Line Interface). The CLI powers many of the commands behind the scenes. It can also be accessed via the Integrated Terminal, which can be handy for features not yet exposed natively in Workbench. To open a CLI window, from the Command Palette enter **Particle: Launch CLI**.

In the Integrated Terminal window you can enter any Particle CLI commands, for example:

```
particle help
particle --version
particle libraries list
```

![Integrated CLI](/assets/images/workbench/cli.png)

### Cloud build and flash locally

Combining the cloud compile and integrated CLI, you can, for example, compile in the cloud and then flash to an Boron or Electron over USB to save on cellular data usage.


After you've done **Particle: Cloud Compile** you'll notice a new .bin file created in your workspace. In this example, it's **electron\_firmware\_1548790892661.bin**.

From the Command Palette enter **Particle: Launch CLI**. 

The device must be connected by USB and in DFU mode (blinking yellow). Hold down the MODE (or SETUP) button while tapping RESET. Continue to hold down MODE (or SETUP) while the status LED blinks magenta (red and blue at the same time), until it blinks yellow, then release.

Then type in a command like:

```
particle flash --usb electron_firmware_1548790892661.bin
```

You can just type the first few letters of the filename then hit Tab to auto-complete the rest.

![Local Compiler](/assets/images/workbench/flash-binary-usb.png)



### Integrated Serial Monitor

One handy debugging technique is to use the USB debug serial port. Open the Command Palette and select **Particle: Serial Monitor**.

Normally, when the device restarts (such as after flashing new code) the serial port is disconnected, but you are presented with an option to automatically reconnect or not.


### IntelliSense

Workbench leans heavily on the built-in IntelliSense features of Visual Studio Code and the C++ language support provided by the official [C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) extension. Workbench works behind the scenes to automatically configures the C/C++ extension work with Device OS.


You can see IntelliSense in action by starting to type `Particle.` and see suggestions for public functions.

![Intellisense](/assets/images/workbench/intellisense1.png)

Or possible arguments.

![Intellisense Arguments](/assets/images/workbench/intellisense2.png)

IntelliSense for C++ includes a slew of advanced features for you to explore. For example, you can “peek” to the definition of a function.

![Intellisense Peek](/assets/images/workbench/intellisense2.png)


### Particle Themes

Workbench includes two Particle-inspired theme to add a little pizazz to Workbench, **Matter (by Particle)** and **Dark Matter (by Particle)**.

To change the color theme, open the Command Palette and select **Preferences - Color Theme**.

![Themes](/assets/images/workbench/themes.png)

You can scroll through the list to try out the available themes, or select **Install Additional Color Themes** to select one from the Marketplace. There are a lot of them!

### Keymaps

If you are used to a different development environment, you can use  keymaps to switch the keyboard shortcuts to be similar to the other environment.

To change the keymap, open the Command Palette and select **Preferences: Keymaps**.

Some popular options include:

- Vim
- Sublime
- Atom (Particle Dev is based on Atom)
- IntelliJ
- Visual Studio
- Eclipse
- Emacs

and many more!

### Particle Libraries

Add one of the 3,000+ Device OS libraries with the **Particle: Install Library** command. Workbench will download the requested library, all its dependencies and even example projects.

![Libraries](/assets/images/workbench/libraries.png)

You can search for libraries from the command palette by using **Particle: Find Libraries**. 

For example, I used the **Particle: Install Library** to install the **AssetTrackerRK** library. In the file navigation, you can see the two libraries that it included automatically, AssetTrackerRK and LIS3DH.

Navigating into AssetTrackerRK you can see the source and examples, and also the README.md file. That contains the documentation in most libraries.

![Library Read Me](/assets/images/workbench/library-readme.png)

#### Installing a specific version

You can also install a specific version of a library by using a syntax like `dotstar@0.0.4`. You can also change the version by editing the project.properties file at the top of your project.

#### Removing a library

To remove a library, you should:

- Remove the entry for it in your `project.properties` file in the top level of your project.
- If there's a folder for it in the `lib` directory at the top level of your project, remove that too.

#### Using a locally modified library

You'll notice a copy of the libraries you've added in the `lib` directory in the top level of your project. This is handy for viewing the source and examples.

If you want to make modifications to the library, be sure to remove the library from the `project.properties` file in the top level of your project. If you leave the library in project.properties the official release will be used to build. If you remove it, then the local version you modified in your `lib` directory will be used instead.

### Snippets

Code snippets are templates that make it easier to enter repeating code patterns, such as loops or conditional-statements. We’ve included snippets for the bits of code we use most often for your Device OS apps. For example, start typing `dw` and hit `tab` to expand the snippet. You can `tab` between input entries, which includes suggestions.

![Snippets](/assets/images/workbench/snippets.gif)


### Debugging (3rd-generation)

_Note: There are a handful of limitations around debugging 3rd-generation hardware. Please [see below](#disabling-mesh-networking-and-bluetooth) for details._

For this tutorial, you'll use the [TinkerBreak source](/assets/files/eclipse-debug/tinkerbreak.cpp). This is the same application used in the [Eclipse Debug Tutorial](https://support.particle.io/hc/en-us/articles/360039741253/). As you'll see, this is way easier in Workbench! 

- You'll need two USB connections to your computer: Your device, connected by a micro USB cable, and the Particle debugger, either directly plugged into a USB A port, or into a USB A extension cable. The Particle Debugger also needs to connect to your device using the included ribbon cable as described in the [Particle Debugger](/datasheets/accessories/gen3-accessories/#debugger) documentation.

![Debugger](/assets/images/debugger3.jpg)

- Create a new project using the Command Palette and **Particle: Create New Project**.
- Rename TinkerBreak.ino to TinkerBreak.cpp. Paste in the [TinkerBreak source](/assets/files/eclipse-debug/tinkerbreak.cpp) into TinkerBreak.cpp.

![Debug Workspace](/assets/images/workbench/debug-1.png)

- From the Command Palette select **Particle: Configure Workspace for Device** and choose the Device OS and type of device you want to use.
- Connect the Particle Debugger using the ribbon cable to your Argon, Boron, or Xenon device.
- Connect the device to your computer by USB.
- Click the Debug icon (1), then select the correct Debugger (2). In this case, it's **Particle Debugger (argon, boron, xenon)**. Note that you need to select the type of device in both places!

![Debug View](/assets/images/workbench/debug-2.png)

- Click the green arrow next to DEBUG in the upper left to build, flash, and begin debugging.
- After flashing the device will typically halt. You can tell because the device status LED will go off.

![Debug Console](/assets/images/workbench/debug-3.png)

- Click **Debug Console** (1). The error shown is normal.
- Click **Continue** (2). The device should boot up normally and get to breathing cyan.

You're now debugging the application!

- From the Command Palette select **Particle: Launch CLI**. In the CLI window, enter a command like:

```
particle call argon2 break
```

Replace argon2 with the name of the device you're testing with. This should call a function via the cloud.

- The command is entered in the Terminal tab (1).
- Execution has stopped at the code breakpoint (2).
- You can see the call stack (3).
- You can continue execution using **Continue** (4).

![Debug Console](/assets/images/workbench/debug-4.png)

You can also set your own breakpoints.

- Scroll down to line 51. Click to the left of the line number so a red dot appears (1)
- You'll also see it listed in the breakpoints tab (2).

![Debug Break](/assets/images/workbench/debug-5.png)

- From the Terminal window, enter a command like:

```
particle call argon2 div 10
```

- Now you can see the execution has stopped (1). Sometimes it won't stop exactly on the line you put the breakpoint on.
- The call stack (2) is much more interesting this time.
- You can see the variables (3)!
- When done, **Continue** (4).

![Debug Breakpoint](/assets/images/workbench/debug-6.png)

#### Disabling Mesh Networking and Bluetooth

In some cases you may need to disable mesh networking and Bluetooth on your device in order to safely pause at break-points and step. If your device signals SOS ([example](/tutorials/device-os/led/argon/#red-flash-sos)) while debugging, try adding `Mesh.off();` and `BLE.off();` to the top of the `setup()` function in the TinkerBreak.cpp source file like this:

```
void setup()
{
    // Disable mesh networking and bluetooth - note: Gen3 Hardware (argon, boron, xenon, bsom, etc) only!
    Mesh.off();
    BLE.off();

    //...rest of setup fn calls
}
```

#### Disabling Optimization

In the TinkerBreak.cpp source file, you'll notice this at the top of the file. This is helpful to add to your source files to turn off compiler optimization, making it easier to debug. Otherwise you can't break on some lines, and some local variables won't be available.

```
#pragma GCC optimize ("O0")
```

#### Debugging FreeRTOS

By default, you cannot step into the underlying FreeRTOS (real-time operating system code). You can enable it by adding:

```
"rtos":"FreeRTOS"
```

to your `launch.json` file. This is experimental and may cause the GDB server to crash or malfunction, so it's best to only enable this if necessary.


That is just a brief introduction to debugging. For more information, see the [VS Code Debugging Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging).


### Debugging (2nd-generation with Particle Debugger)

- You'll need two USB connections to your computer: Your device, connected by a micro USB cable, and the Particle debugger, either directly plugged into a USB A port, or into a USB A extension cable. The Particle Debugger also needs to connect to your device's D6 and D7 pins as described in the [Particle Debugger](/datasheets/accessories/gen3-accessories/#debugger) documentation.

- Create a new project using the Command Palette and **Particle: Create New Project**. If you already created a project for the 3rd-generation device, you can just reuse that one.
- Rename TinkerBreak.ino to TinkerBreak.cpp. Paste in the [TinkerBreak source](/assets/files/eclipse-debug/tinkerbreak.cpp) into TinkerBreak.cpp.

![Debug Workspace](/assets/images/workbench/debug-1.png)

- From the Command Palette select **Particle: Configure Workspace for Device** and choose the Device OS and type of device you want to use. In this example, a Photon is used.
- Connect the Particle Debugger to your device.

With the Particle Debugger positioned like this, USB connector toward you and the headers facing up:

![Debugger](/assets/images/debugger1.jpg)

| Left Header | Right Header |
| --- | ----- |
| VDD | SWCLK |
| RTS | SWDIO |
| RX  | NC    |
| TX  | NC    |  
| CTS | GND   | 
| GND | VUSB  |

You need to connect:

| Pin | Function | Color |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GND | GND | Black |
| D7 | SWDIO | Green | 
| D6 | SWCLK | Blue |


![Debugger](/assets/images/workbench/debug-11.jpg)

- Connect the device to your computer by USB.
- Click the Debug icon (1), then select the correct Debugger (2). In this case, it's **Particle Debugger (photon, p1, electron)**. Note that you need to select the type of device in both places!

![Debug Workspace](/assets/images/workbench/debug-10.png)

The rest of the instructions are the same as for 3rd-generation.

### Settings

There are a number of settings available to customize the experience of using Workbench. The Settings window are available through the menus **Code > Preferences > Settings** (Mac) or **File > Preferences > Settings**. Expand **Extensions** and select **Particle**.

![Preferences Settings](/assets/images/workbench/preferences-settings.png)

Some of the available settings are:
- **Compile Button Action** and **Flash Button Action**: toggles the [Compile and Flash buttons](#compile-and-flash-buttons) between local compile/flash and cloud compile/flash.

![Compile Button Action](/assets/images/workbench/compileButtonAction.png)

- **Disable Welcome Screen**: don't show the Welcome screen at start-up.

- **Disable Local Compiler Dirty Check**: don't recommend running the clean task when the target Device OS version has been previously built.

- **Enable Verbose Local Compiler Logging**: print log messages for each Device OS file being compiled. The default is to print only warnings, errors and completion messages.

- **Compile Defines**: Specify a list of preprocessor definitions to set while compiling your application (local compilation only).

- **Custom Device OS Location**: Source Device OS from a custom location - see [FAQ](https://support.particle.io/hc/en-us/articles/360039251434/#working-with-a-custom-device-os-build).

## Source Code Management

Visual Studio Code provides support for a number of source code management providers. Source code management makes it easy for team members to share code, track changes over time, and provide a cloud-based repository for storing a copy of your code.

[The VS Code Instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol) are a great place to start.

Particle open source projects and many community libraries are stored in GitHub, and there is good support for Git in VS Code, so that's often a good choice. You can get started at the [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/) website.

## Command Palette Reference

	
### Particle: Audit Environment

Prints information about the VS Code environment and settings to the Output window. This can be useful to send in [technical support requests](https://particle.io/support). 

If you are sharing the information in a public place like the [community forums](https://community.particle.io) be sure there isn't sensitive information you do not want to share in the data.

### Particle: Call Function

Call a function on a device. The device is selected with **Particle: Configure Workspace For Device** and you are prompted for the name of the function to call and the optional parameter. The device must be online and breathing cyan and have registered that function in order to call it.

### Particle: Add / Remove `particle` Command in PATH

The Particle CLI (command line interface) is used for many operations within Particle Workbench. This option can be used to add or remove it from the command line tool search path.

### Particle: Clean application (local)

The Clean options remove the intermediate object files and built binaries. This option removes only the application intermediate files, leaving the Device OS binaries unchanged. You might want to do this if you are getting unexpected compile errors in your application.

These are kept separate for each Device OS version, platform (Photon, P1, Electron/E Series, Argon, Boron, Xenon, etc.), as well as debug (monolithic) and non-debug (modular).

### Particle: Clean application & DeviceOS (local)

The Clean options remove the intermediate object files and built binaries. This option removes both the application and Device OS intermediate files.

These are kept separate for each Device OS version, platform (Photon, P1, Electron/E Series, Argon, Boron, Xenon, etc.), as well as debug (monolithic) and non-debug (modular).

### Particle: Clean application for debug (local)

The Clean options remove the intermediate object files and built binaries. For debug (monolithic) builds this option removes all of the intermediate files for both your application and Device OS.

These are kept separate for each Device OS version, platform (Photon, P1, Electron/E Series, Argon, Boron, Xenon, etc.), as well as debug (monolithic) and non-debug (modular).

### Particle: Cloud Compile

This option compiles in the cloud and downloads the binary to the top level of your project. This can be useful for verifying that your source compiles and also for getting binaries to upload and product firmware.

This is handy for quickly checking the syntax of your program, and also if you want to compile in the cloud and flash by USB to save on data for cellular devices like the Electron and Boron.

The device type and Device OS version are selected with **Particle: Configure Workspace For Device**. 

The filename will be of the form <i>platform</i>\_firmware\_<i>number</i>.bin. For example: boron_firmware_1598526579205.bin in the top level of your project directory.

### Particle: Cloud Flash

This option compiles in the cloud and flashes the code to the device OTA.

The device type, Device OS version, and device name are selected with **Particle: Configure Workspace For Device**. 

### Particle: Compile application (local)

This option compiles your user firmware using the local compiler toolchain. It will create a firmware binary, but does not flash to the device. You may want to use this option to create a binary to upload as product firmware.

When you first install a new compiler version, you should use the **Particle: Flash application & DeviceOS (local)** option at least once to make sure your device has the correct Device OS version installed.

The device type and Device OS version are selected using **Particle: Install Local Compiler**.

The resulting binary will be in the target directory. For example, if you are building the project **MyProject** for boron version 1.5.2, the resulting binary will be **target/1.5.2/boron/MyProject.bin**.

### Particle: Compile application & DeviceOS (local)

This option compiles both Device OS and your user firmware using the local compiler toolchain. It will create a set of binaries, but does not flash to the device. The **Particle: Flash application & DeviceOS (local)** can be used to both compile and flash.

The device type and Device OS version are selected using **Particle: Install Local Compiler**.

### Particle: Compile application for debug (local)

This option compiles both Device OS and your user firmware using the local compiler toolchain as a monolithic debug build. It will create a single monolithic binary containing both Device OS and user firmware, but does not flash to the device. The **Particle: Flash application for debug (local)** can be used to both compile and flash.

The device type and Device OS version are selected using **Particle: Install Local Compiler**.

### Particle: Configure Workspace For Device

Selects the version of Device OS, device type (Photon, P1, Electron, Argon, Boron, Xenon, etc.) and optionally a specific device name to work with. 

This is used by the **Particle: Cloud Compile**. When using **Particle: Cloud Flash**, **Particle: Call Function** or **Particle: Read Variable** you must include the device name to work with.

### Particle: Create New Project

Create a new project. Typically each firmware binary or user application is a single project, and you only open one project at a time. 

It is possible to have a multi-root workspace, where there are multiple projects visible at once. The downside is that for many operations like **Particle: Flash application (local)** you then need to select which of the available projects you want to build.

### Particle: Find Libraries

Find a Particle library. You can enter a portion of a name and it will return matching libraries. For example, searching for **DS18** results in:

```html
$ particle library search DS18
> Found 2 libraries matching DS18
DS18B20 0.1.12 101761 DSB18XX Lib for Particle devices
ds18x20 0.0.4 6487 DS18B20/DS18S20 library with support for multiple sensors
```

You can then use **Particle: Install Library** to install it.

### Particle: Flash application (local)

This option compiles your user firmware using the local compiler toolchain. It will create a firmware binary and also flash it to the device over USB. The device will be placed into DFU mode (blinking yellow) automatically.

When you first install a new compiler version, you should use the **Particle: Flash application & DeviceOS (local)** option at least once to make sure your device has the correct Device OS version installed.

The device type and Device OS version are selected using **Particle: Install Local Compiler**.

### Particle: Flash application & DeviceOS (local)

This option compiles both Device OS and your user firmware using the local compiler toolchain. It will create a set of binaries also flash them to the device over USB. The device will be placed into DFU mode (blinking yellow) automatically.

The device type and Device OS version are selected using **Particle: Install Local Compiler**.

### Particle: Flash application for debug (local)

This option compiles both Device OS and your user firmware using the local compiler toolchain as a monolithic debug build. It will create a single monolithic binary containing both Device OS and user firmware and also flash it to the device over USB. The device will be placed into DFU mode (blinking yellow) automatically.

The device type and Device OS version are selected using **Particle: Install Local Compiler**.

### Particle: Get Help

Provides links to various useful resources for Workbench.

### Particle: Import Project

For an existing Particle project containing a project.properties file, creates the additional directories and files needed to use it with VS Code.

### Particle: Install Library

Add a library to the current project. You can search for library using **Particle: Find Libraries** if you are not sure of the exact name. You can specify a specific version, for example `DS18B20@0.1.11`.

This adds the library to the `project.properties` file at the top level of your project and downloads the source to the `lib` directory.

### Particle: Install Local Compiler

Install a local compiler toolchain and Device OS source. You need to do this for any specific version of Device OS that you want to target. You can remove unneeded compilers by using **Particle: Uninstall Local Compiler**.

### Particle: Launch CLI

Opens a Terminal window pane to use Particle CLI commands directly. Note that you still need to enter the particle command, as in:

```
particle help
```

### Particle: Launch Compiler Shell

Opens a Terminal window pane to issue make commands directly with more options. A help screen is displayed when you open the compiler shell with the available options.

Normally you'll just use options like **Particle: Flash application (local)** instead of using the compiler shell.

### Particle: Login

Log in to a Particle account. This is necessary to cloud compile and flash. The **Particle: Who Am I?** command can be used to determine who you are logged in as. 

You'll be prompted to enter your email, password, and optionally a 6-digit login code (aka `otp`) if two-step authentication (aka `2FA`) is enabled for the account.

Upon signing-in if you see an error notification, click the "view log" button and review the error details. If you see `Could not validate OTP`, that means 2FA _is enabled_ and the login code is _required_. If instead you see `User credentials are invalid`, that means you entered the wrong email or password.

### Particle: Logout

Log out from a Particle account so a different user can log in. 

If you are on a shared computer you should always logout before exiting Workbench as you'll be automatically logged in when restarting if you don't log out first.

### Particle: Read Variable

Read a Particle variable from a device. The device is selected with **Particle: Configure Workspace For Device** and you are prompted for the name of the variable to read. The device must be online and breathing cyan and have registered that variable to read it.

### Particle: Reset Environment

This will uninstall and reinstall your local compilers. This takes a while to execute, but can clear up problems caused by a corrupted install.

### Particle: Serial Monitor

Opens a Serial Port window to a device connected by USB. You can optionally have the connection reopened when the device restarts (such as when flashing new code), or just disconnect. If there are multiple devices connected by USB, you may be prompted to choose which one.

The serial monitor is often used for debugging to view the output from commands like `Log.info` and `Serial.print` in your firmware.

### Particle: Show Welcome Screen

Shows the Welcome Screen. The Particle icon in the left toolbar also does this.

### Particle: Uninstall Local Compiler

Uninstall a version of the local compiler. Use this to remove versions you no longer need to save disk space. You'll be prompted to select what version you want to remove.

### Particle: Update CLI

Update the included Particle CLI (command line interface) to the latest version.

### Particle: Who Am I?

Shows who you are logged in as. A small popup window will display in the lower right with the account email address.


## Migration Guide

- The **Show cloud variables** and **Show cloud functions** menu items do not have a direct replacement but the Command Palette **Particle: Launch CLI** and using the `particle list` CLI command does return the same information (for all of your devices).


![Particle Dev Status Bar](/assets/images/workbench/dev-status.png)

In the bottom status bar:

- The device selector is replaced by the Command Palette **Particle: Configure Workspace for Device**.
- The other status bar information is displayed on the VS Code status bar. If the status bar is not visible, you can change that using Command Palette **View: Toggle Status Bar Visibility**.

If you are used to the editing keyboard shortcuts, you can install the Atom keymap. Open the Command Palette and select **Preferences: Keymaps**.

## Working with Products

When you are working on a product there are any number of possible scenarios, but this one is common and works well:

- Each developer has their own Particle account and device on their desk for use with the product. This makes it easy to access the USB debug serial port, buttons, etc.. 
- These developers are [team members](/tutorials/device-cloud/console/#adding-team-members) for the product, so they can access the product test fleet.
- The developer's desktop device is claimed to the developer's account. 
- This device uses the [Mark As Development Device](/tutorials/product-tools/development-devices/) feature. This allows it to be part of the product, but combined with being claimed to the developer's account, allows it to be flashed directly from Particle Workbench.

The normal workflow is to use Particle Workbench to develop firmware. You can use any of the local or cloud compile options, and flash over USB or OTA as desired.

Once the firmware is ready for larger testing:

- The `PRODUCT_VERSION` is updated, if it has not already been updated.
- A version of the firmware is built and downloaded, using the **Particle: Cloud Compile** or **Particle: Compile application (local)** option to create a firmware binary. The Particle CLI cloud compiler is another option.
- This version is uploaded to the console as [product firmware](/tutorials/device-cloud/console/#rollout-firmware).

You can then:

- Lock and flash a single device in your product test fleet for further testing
- Release the firmware to a device group, such as a beta test group.
- Release the firmware to all devices.

![Workflow](/assets/images/release-firmware-flow.png)


## Working with GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a tool for source code control, issue, and release management. It's great for managing Particle projects in Workbench. For many uses, it's free, too. There are many features, entire books, and tutorials about [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (the underlying source code control system) and GitHub (a service that allows you to store files in the cloud). This is just an overview.

Source code control allows you to have a secure record of all of the changes you've made to the source over time. You can roll back to previous versions and compare versions. It also makes sure you have a copy of all of your source separate from your computer, in case something happens to it.

Sign up for a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account if you have not already done so. You will select a username at this point, which will be your primary method of identification, not your email address. Your username will be shown publicly in many instances, so keep that in mind.

Most operations are centered around a **repository**. In many cases, each repository will be a single project. However, in some cases you might want to store multiple Particle firmware projects in a single repository when they are related. For example, if you were writing Bluetooth LE (BLE) communication software, one firmware might be for the central role and one might be the peripheral role, but since they're both part of one project you'd store the source in a single repository.

Each repository can be **public** or **private**. If you are creating an open-source project or library, **public** typically used. Using GitHub **teams** multiple users can access private repositories. Everyone working on a project should always have their own GitHub account; you should never share an account.

While you can download code from the GitHub website, you will probably want to install a [desktop GitHub client](https://desktop.github.com/) on your computer. You should install both the graphical and command line options. 

There is also support for GitHub built into Visual Studio Code (Particle Workbench), but it uses your computer's GitHub desktop installation so you still need to install a desktop client.

### Creating a new project 

If you are creating a new project, from the Command Palette in Workbench, you select **Particle: Create New Project**. Select the location and name for the project.

![Source Control](/assets/images/workbench/github1.png)

Click the **Source Control** icon in the left toolbar. Then click **Publish to GitHub**. This will create a private repository for the currently logged in user. 

- Select the name (the default is the name of the project folder, which is usually a good choice)
- Select the files you want to commit (the default is probably fine for personal projects)

Now if you go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) you should see your project! It's currently private, but you can make it public later, if you want to.

### Making a source code change

![GitHub Stage and Commit](/assets/images/workbench/github-stage.png)

Once you've made some source changes and tested them, you might want to **Commit** and **Push** these changes. 

- Before you can commit you need to **Stage** your changes, which lets Git know you indeed want to upload all of these changes. The easiest way is to click on the **Stage All Changes** (1) + button. It's hidden by default but will appear if you hover over the spot.

- Enter a commit message in the box (2). This can be a reminder of why you made the change.

- Click the **Commit** icon (3) (check mark). This saves a record of the changes, but the changes still only live on your computer.

For personal projects like this you will typically just push to master. This sends the data to the GitHub servers. For more complex projects with team members, code reviews, etc. you will likely use a more complex process of **Pull Requests** instead.

- Click on the **...** (Views and More Actions) at the top of the Source Control tab. Select **Push**. 

Now the changes should be visible on the GitHub web site. Also if other team members **Fetch** and **Pull** the project they'll get your latest changes.

To summarize:

  - **Stage** indicates this file should be committed
  - **Commit** marks all of the changes are ready to go as one package of changes
  - **Push** uploads the package of changes to GitHub

### Making a copy of a project (Clone Repository)

Often you will want to work on a project that has already been created on GitHub. The process of creating a working copy of a project is to **Clone** it. Cloning only makes a copy of it on your computer and doesn't affect the project that you are cloning at this stage. Feel free to clone all you want!

![GitHub Clone](/assets/images/workbench/github-clone.png)

- Open a new Workbench Windows or otherwise have a window with no project selected. Click on the **Source Controll** icon on the left side. Click the **Clone Repository** button.

- Enter the GitHub Repository URL in the box. For example: [https://github.com/particle-iot/tracker-edge](https://github.com/particle-iot/tracker-edge)

- Select the parent directory of where you want the repository to be cloned to and click **Select Repository Location**.

Now you have a clone of the repository. You can make all of the changes you want in your clone as long as you don't use things like Commit or Push. However you won't have the benefits of source control for your changes. To do that, you may want to **fork** or **mirror**.

### Creating a fork

The process of taking an existing project and duplicating it into your own GitHub where you can make changes with full source control is known as creating a **fork**. You might want to do this if you want to make changes to an existing library. Once caveat of fork: the visibility of a fork is always the same as the original. If the original was a public repository, your fork will be too.

You can do this by going to the original repository in GitHub and clicking on the **Fork** button in the upper left.

### Creating a mirror

There is another option that is more common when working with Tracker Edge projects: **Mirror**. A mirror allows you to make a private copy of a repository and link the two, so you can later merge any changes in the original with your changes! This is a power user feature, so you'll need to use some command-line git commands to make it work.

![Create repository](/assets/images/workbench/github-create-repo.png)

Create a new Github repository in your account. In this case, I created **tracker-test1** and made it a private repository. Since we're going to mirror, it's not necessary to create a README or LICENSE.

```bash
git clone --bare https://github.com/particle-iot/tracker-edge.git
cd tracker-edge.git
git push --mirror https://github.com/rickkas7/tracker-test1.git
```

Run the commands to mirror the changes into the repository you just created. Be sure to change the last URL to match the URL for your repository!

At this point you can delete the tracker-edge.git directory as it's no longer needed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rickkas7/tracker-test1.git
cd tracker-test1
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Make a clone of your repository and initialize the submodules.

Open your project in Workbench:

  - Open Particle Workbench.
  - From the command palette, **Particle: Import Project**. Select the project.properties file in the tracker-test1 directory.
  - Run **Particle: Configure Workspace for Device**, select version 1.5.4-rc.1, 2.0.0-rc.3, or later, Tracker, and your device.
  - Run **Particle: Compile and Flash**.

Now that you have a mirror, you're free to do things like update main.cpp and even edit the other Tracker source as desired. When you **Stage**, **Commit** and **Push**, the changes will be saved to your own GitHub private repository only.

```bash
cd tracker-test1
git remote add official https://github.com/particle-iot/tracker-edge.git
```

Link the two repositories. This makes it possible to merge changes from the official version later on, when new versions of Tracker Edge are released. This merge is smart, so it won't overwrite your changes if there are no conflicts, but if both you and Particle changed the same lines of source, this may be flagged as a conflict and you will need to manually figure out which to keep. You only need to run this command once.

```
cd tracker-test1
git pull official develop
```

This is how to merge updates from the official repository into yours. When a new version of Tracker Edge is released, you run a command to pull the changes from that release into your repository. You then resolve any conflicts and then push the changes to your repository. The steps are:

- **Pull** the changes from the official repository
- Resolve any conflicts
- **Push** the merged changes to your repository.

```
cd tracker-test1
git pull official release/v8
```

If you prefer, you can merge to a specific release instead of develop.


## Developing Particle Libraries

There is limited support for developing [Particle Libraries](/tutorials/device-os/libraries/) in Workbench. 

### Create a project.properties file

You will need to create a **project.properties** file in the top of your library source directory. The easiest way is to duplicate your **library.properties** file. You should have both files. 

The **project.properties** file must contain a name and the name of the library, such as:

```
name=AMCLCD-RK
```

If you duplicated your  **library.properties** it should have a name already. The reason is that Workbench will not open a project directory that does not have a **project.properties** file.

### Import Project

From the Command Palette, select **Particle: Import Project**. Now that the directory contains a project.properties file, you will be able to import it. 

Now the library will appears in your Workbench window and have Intellisense highlighting.

### Building Examples - Using CLI

The main caveat is that there is no built-in support for building library examples using local build. The easiest solution is to the Particle CLI cloud compiler manually.

From the Command Palette, select **Particle: Launch CLI** to open a shell panel. 

Use the [`particle compile`](/reference/developer-tools/cli/#particle-compile) to build the binary. For example:

```bash
particle compile boron examples/1-simple --saveTo firmware.bin
```

This compiles the example **1-simple** and saves the binary. 

```bash
particle flash test2 examples/1-simple 
```

This compiles and flashes the device named **test2** OTA with the example firmware.


### Building Examples - Local Build

If you really do need to do a local build, for example, if you need to use the debugger, the only solution is to temporarily copy the files from the example you want to build into the **src** directory. Don't forget to remove them before publishing the library!

### Uploading and Publishing

The easiest way to upload or publish your library is to select **Particle: Launch CLI** to open a shell panel. This will also set it up with the correct directory so you can:

```bash
particle library upload
```

This uploads the library as a private library so you can test it.

```bash
particle library publish
```

This publishes the library, making it public and visible to all other users.

### Starting from Scratch

If you are making a brand new library from scratch, you may want to use **Particle: Create New Project**. This will create the project.properties and src directories. Then you will want to:

- Create the [**library.properties**](/tutorials/device-os/libraries/#library-properties-fields) file.
- In the **src** directory, remove the *YourLibraryName*.ino file and instead create *YourLibraryName*.cpp and *YourLibraryName*.h.
- Create the **examples** directory.
- Create subdirectories in **examples** for each of your examples, with a main source file in each.
