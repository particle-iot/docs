# Beyond Prototyping

*Going from solderless breadboards to SMD components across Particle devices*

### Solderless breadboards 1

One of the most common ways to start building your project is to use a solderless breadboard. Here's my switch demo circuit in pure prototyping mode. There's an [RGB LED](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10821) and an [LED button](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10440) to the right of the Argon. This version uses long flexible wires, which are easy to set up and are easily reusable.

This is the schematic for the circuit:

![Schematic](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/schematic1.png)

Because the LED button switch pins don't line up with the holes on a solderless breadboard (0.1"), there's a [small adapter board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10467).

### Solderless breadboards 2

One way to dress up your project is to switch to solid wires. It's a bit more work, but it certainly looks more professional and is good for projects you want to keep as-is.

![Breadboard with solid wire](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/solidwire1.jpg)

![Breadboard with solid wire](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/solidwire2.jpg)

I used a combination of [pre-formed wires](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WLPN929/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title) and wires I cut, stripped, and bent to length from a [SparkFun hookup wire kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11367).

![Solid wires](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/solidwire3.jpg)


### Perma-Proto

Once you've built and tested your solderless breadboard with solid wires, the next step up is an [Adafruit Perma-Proto](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1609) board. It has the same wiring as a solderless breadboard, but you solder the wires in place.

![Perma-Proto with Argon](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/perma-proto6.jpg)


Resist the temptation to solder your device in place. Always use sockets, otherwise it's really a pain to troubleshoot or swap out the device if a problem occurs.

- Gen 3 feather (Argon and Boron): 1x [12-pin](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/sullins-connector-solutions/PPTC121LFBN-RC/S6100-ND/807231), 1x [16-pin](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/sullins-connector-solutions/PPTC161LFBN-RC/S7014-ND/810154)
- Photon: 2x [12-pin](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/sullins-connector-solutions/PPTC121LFBN-RC/S6100-ND/807231)
- Electron: 2x [18-pin](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sullins-connector-solutions/PPTC181LFBN-RC/810156)

Note that you should use these headers or ones like them. The spacing between rows is not the same as most IC sockets. Plus, the pins on Particle devices are square, not the flat like IC chip leads, and wouldn't fit securely in an IC socket.

![Perma-Proto Comparison](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/perma-proto1.jpg)
![Perma-Proto Bottom](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/perma-proto2.jpg)

All you need to do is transfer over the component and wires and solder them to the board!

### Feather prototyping board

One of the nice features of the Gen 3 prototyping devices is the use of the [Adafruit Feather form-factor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather/feather-specification). Not only does this allow the devices to be easily swapped, but there are a large number of accessories like displays, GPS modules, and sensors already built in the Feather form-factor. Using a doubler, tripler, or quadrupler, you can add these to your project with no loose wires and no soldering!

However, sometimes you want something a little more custom. In this version, instead of using a big perma-proto board, I used a little FeatherWing solder prototype board. This is one in a Feather Doubler with an Argon:

![Feather Prototype Board](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/feather-proto1.jpg)

And the board itself:

![Feather Prototype Board](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/feather-proto2.jpg)
![Feather Prototype Board](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/feather-proto3.jpg)


### Feather PTH board (through-hole components)

While the previous soldered boards all work fine, you can really make things look professional with a custom printed circuit board. This one uses hand-soldered through-hole components. It's referred to a PTH, plated through-hole.

![Custom PTH board](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/pth3.jpg)

I created the board schematic in [Eagle CAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview). This small two-layer board can be done in the free version of Eagle CAD. 

The Eagle CAD schematic and board files are in the **eagle** directory in the [Github repository](https://github.com/particle-iot/docs-tutorials/tree/master/beyond-prototyping).

![Schematic](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/schematic1.png)

The other part is creating the board file, which includes the actual placement of the components and the traces, which take the place of the wires. Here's by board file in Eagle.

![Custom PTH board](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/pth-board.png)

I ordered these board from [OshPark](https://oshpark.com). 

![Custom PTH board](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/pth1.jpg)

Here are the components soldered in place. It's way faster to solder the components onto a circuit board than mess with all of the individual wires. And it looks so neat and clean!

![Custom PTH board](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/pth2.jpg)

### Feather SMD components board

The next step up is to switch to use SMD (surface mount device) components. The switch button is still through-hole soldered, but the resistors and LED are SMD. 

As your designs get more complex, being able to use smaller SMD components saves space and is actually easier than hand soldering once you get the hang of it. Also, many modern ICs are only available in SMD form-factor. The SMD RGB LED in this design is significantly less expensive than the PTH LED used above ($0.19 vs. $2.05).

![SMD board](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/smd1.jpg)

The SMD LED uses different current-limiting resistors but the schematic is otherwise the same.

![SMD schematic](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/smd-schematic.png)

![SMD board in Eagle](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/smd-board.png)

In order to assemble a SMD board, you'll use solder paste. I like this kind in a little syringe. This is [low-temperature solder paste](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017RSGPI8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title), which is easy to work with and is lead-free.

![Solder Paste](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/smd2.jpg)

Like the previous board, I ordered it from [OshPark](https://oshpark.com). Using the small syringe tip I put a little dot of solder on all of the SMD pads.

![Solder paste](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/smd3.jpg)

The next step is to place the components on the board. I like to use forceps and a dental pick. Some people prefer tweezers.

![Tools](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/smd6.jpg)

The the board goes into the reflow oven. This is an inexpensive T-962 which works fine for simple boards. 

![Reflow Oven](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/smd4.jpg)

There are a number of DIY techniques including using a skillet or baking them in a toaster oven, but using a real reflow oven is more accurate.

And here's the board after reflow soldering:

![SMD Complete](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/smd5.jpg)

The Eagle CAD schematic and board files are in the **eagle** directory in the [Github repository](https://github.com/particle-iot/docs-tutorials/tree/master/beyond-prototyping).

### Wing under-mount board

You don't need to make your boards into the actual FeatherWing form-factor. You can make an under-mount board as well. This is handy for larger designs. 

![Under-Mount Board](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/under2.jpg)

The schematic is the same, but the Eagle board layout is different:

![Under-Mount Eagle](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/under-board.png)

### Photon (Gen 2 Wi-Fi)

The Photon board is a lot like the under-mount FeatherWing board, but it has two [12-pin headers](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/sullins-connector-solutions/PPTC121LFBN-RC/S6100-ND/807231) to fit a Photon.

![Photon](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/photon.jpg)

The Gen 2 devices (Photon, P1, Electron, and E Series) use different pins because the STM32F205 processor supports PWM for the RGB LED on different pins. Thus the schematic is slightly different:

![Photon Schematic](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/photon-schematic.png)

The Eagle CAD schematic and board files are in the **eagle** directory in the [Github repository](https://github.com/particle-iot/docs-tutorials/tree/master/beyond-prototyping).

### Electron (Gen 2 cellular)

The Electron board is nearly identical to the Photon, except it has [18-pin headers](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sullins-connector-solutions/PPTC181LFBN-RC/810156) instead of 12-pin. In fact, you can plug in a Photon into the Electron board if you align the pins on the left, leaving the unused socket pins on the right closest to the switch.

![Electron](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/electron.png)

### P1 (Gen 2 Wi-Fi SMD)

Making a board for the P1 module is more difficult than the devices we've used so far. It's recommended that you include:

- RGB LED (the status one)
- RESET and MODE buttons
- USB connector
- 3.3V Regulator

To match the other boards, this design includes a second RGB LED and LED button switch. It also includes a 10-pin micro SWD/JTAG connector and the blue D7 LED (optional).

### E Series (Gen 2 cellular SMD)

The E Series Gen 2 cellular module is about the same level of effort as the P1. It has a built-in voltage regulator and PMIC, but you need to add a battery connector.

- RGB LED (the status one)
- RESET and MODE buttons
- USB connector
- Battery connector
- Charge LED (I forgot to add this in the design here)

## Publish Demo

The publish demo uses publish and subscribe to communicate between demo boards. Each device has its own button color programmed in its device firmware. Pressing the button publishes the color, which shows up on all of the other devices.

![Publish Demo](/assets/images/beyond-prototyping/publish.jpg)

It works between Wi-Fi and cellular devices, across Gen 2 and Gen 3 devices!

To make it easier to test a single device, I use the test firmware below.

It defaults to fading between colors on the RGB LED. Pressing the button toggles between the various primary RGB colors, and also toggles the LED button on and off.

```
#include "Particle.h"

#include "LedSwitchRK.h"

#include <cmath>

SYSTEM_THREAD(ENABLED);

SerialLogHandler logHandler;

//                         red       green     blue      yellow    cyan      magenta   white

const unsigned long CHANGE_PERIOD_MS = 10;
unsigned long lastChange = 0;

void loop() {
	if (ledSwitch.pressed()) {

		ledSwitch.ledToggle();

		if (++curColor >= (sizeof(testColors) / sizeof(testColors[0]))) {
			// -1 = rainbow
			// 0 - n = color in array testColors[curColor]
			curColor = -1;
		}
		else {
			setColor(testColors[curColor]);
		}
	}

	if (curColor == -1) {
		// Rainbows
		if (millis() - lastChange >= CHANGE_PERIOD_MS) {
			lastChange = millis();

			// Use the degrees as the hue in the HSV color space. That's the direction
			// you are pointing on the color wheel.
			//
			// 1.0 is the saturation. 0.0 is at the center of the color wheel (dark) and
			// 1.0 is the outer edge of the color wheel.
			//
			// 0.6 is the value or brightness. 1.0 is the maximum but I turned it down
			// a bit to be less blinding.
			uint32_t color = HSVtoRGB(curDegree, 1.0, 0.6);
			setColor(color);

			if (++curDegree >= 360) {
				curDegree = 0;
			}
		}
	}

}

int ledToggle(String cmd) {

	Log.info("toggling LED from Particle function");
	ledSwitch.ledToggle();

	return 0;
}

void setColor(uint32_t color) {
	uint8_t red = (uint8_t)((color >> 16) & 0xff);

	analogWrite(STATUS_RED, 255 - red);
	analogWrite(STATUS_GREEN, 255 - green);
	analogWrite(STATUS_BLUE, 255 - blue);

The code depends on the **LedSwitchRK** library.
