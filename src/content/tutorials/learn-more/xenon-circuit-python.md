# Using CircuitPython with a Particle Xenon

This document details steps for using a Particle Xenon as a standalone dev kit running CircuitPython. The steps below will completely remove the Particle Device OS from the Xenon, completely disconnecting the device from the Particle Cloud and device ecosystem.

To complete the steps below, you'll need the following tools:

1. a Particle Xenon
2. Two available USB ports on your computer
3. One Debugger for programming the Xenon, either:
  - A Segger J-Link ([Commerical](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2209) or [EDU](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1369) Version). Note that if you use this approach, you'll also need a [JTAG to SWD Cable Adapter Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2094) and a [10-pin 2.5 Socket Cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1675) to connect to the debugger pins on the Xenon.
  - A [Particle Debugger](https://store.particle.io/collections/accessories/products/particle-debugger)

In addition, you'll need to install the following software:

1. [J-Link Software](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack) if using a Segger J-Link for this tutorial.
2. [nRF Command-Line Tools](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Tools/nRF-Command-Line-Tools/Download#infotabs)
3. [arm gcc compiler](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm). Note: Make sure that the GCC Compiler is in your PATH
4. [OpenOCD](https://support.particle.io/hc/en-us/articles/360039251414/#installing-openocd-manually) unless you've already installed [Particle Workbench](https://particle.io/workbench), in which case OpenOCD will have been installed for you.
5. Lastly, you will need to download a [CircuitPython release](https://circuitpython.org/board/particle_xenon)

## Replacing the Default Bootloader

The first step to using your Xenon with CircuitPython is to replace the Particle bootloader on the device with an nRF52-friendly bootloader. This replacement process is often referred to as "burning a bootloader."

_*NOTE*_: If you want to build the bootloader yourself, follow the instructions below. Alternativly, you can download the latest bootloader from [Adafruit directly](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader/releases) on the releases page for the `Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader` repo. Scroll down and look for a file with a name that starts with `particle_xenon_bootloader-`. Click [here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader/releases/download/0.3.1/particle_xenon_bootloader-0.3.1_s140_6.1.1.hex) for a direct link to the `0.3.1` version.

If you choose to download the bootloader directly, you can skip to [burning the bootloader with OpenOCD](#use-openocd-to-burn-the-bootloader-to-your-xenon)

### Cloning the GitHub Repo

1. In a development folder on your machine, use a terminal to clone the `Adafruit_nRF_Bootloader` repository.

  ```cpp
  git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader && cd Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader
  ```

2. Update dependent modules

  ```cpp
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```

Next, you'll want to build and burn this new bootloader to your Xenon. The approach differs depending on whether you're using the Particle Debugger or Segger J-Link, so be sure to only follow the steps for the debugger you're using.

### Option 1: Burning a new Bootloader with the Particle Debugger

If you're using the Particle Debugger to burn a new bootloader to your Xenon, you'll need to build a `hex` binary, and then use OpenOCD to flash the binary to your device.

#### Build a bootloader hex file

1. From a terminal window, create a `hex` file for the bootloader using the following `MAKE` command. Make sure you're still in the `Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader` directory and run the following command.

  ```cpp
  make BOARD=particle_xenon all combinehex
  ```
You'll see output similar to the following once the command runs
  ```bash
  ‚ùØ make BOARD=particle_xenon all combinehex
  LD particle_xenon_bootloader-0.2.13-21-g454b281-nosd.out

  text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  30020	    212	  22370	  52602	   cd7a	_build-particle_xenon/particle_xenon_bootloader-0.2.13-21-g454b281-nosd.out

  CR particle_xenon_bootloader-0.2.13-21-g454b281-nosd.hex
  CR particle_xenon_bootloader-0.2.13-21-g454b281_s140_6.1.1.hex
  ```
2.  The `hex` file will be created in a `_build-particle_xenon` directory in the bootloader project. Keep track of this path as you'll need it for the next step.

#### Use OpenOCD to burn the bootloader to your Xenon

Next, we'll use OpenOCD to burn this bootloader `hex` file to your Xenon. 

1. First, put your Xenon into DFU Mode by holding down the `MODE` and `RESET` buttons. Then, let go of `RESET`, but continue to hold down the `MODE` button until the RGB LED on the device is blinking yellow.

2. Connect the Particle Debugger to the debug port on your Particle device using the provided ribbon cable, and plug both into your computer. The debug port consists of ten exposed pins protected by some plastic, and you can find it next to the LiPo battery port near the top of the device.

3. Open a terminal window in the directory where you've installed OpenOCD. Alternatively, if you've installed Particle Workbench, you'll find OpenOCD in a directory under `.particle/toolchains/openocd`. For instance, at the time of writing, the OpenOCD binary is in the `0.11.2-adhoc6ea4372.0` directory.

  ```bash
  cd ~/.particle/toolchains/openocd/0.11.2-adhoc6ea4372.0
  ```

4. From the OpenOCD directory, run the `flash list` command to make sure the debugger is correctly connected.

  ```bash
  bin/openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/nrf52-particle.cfg \
  -c "adapter_khz 1000" \
  -c "init" \
  -c "flash list" \
  -c "exit"
  ```
  If you see something like what's in the image below, you're on the right track.

  ![](/assets/images/flash-list.png)

5. Install the Hex file from the step above using the `program` command. Replace the path to the hex file with your own path **NOTE**: If using macOS, the the `~` path shortcut will fail, so be sure to use your entire path from `/Users/user` in the statement below.

  ```bash
  bin/openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/nrf52-particle.cfg \
  -c "adapter_khz 1000" \
  -c "init" \
  -c "program /Users/bsatrom/Development/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader/_build-particle_xenon/particle_xenon_bootloader-0.2.13-21-g454b281_s140_6.1.1.hex 0x000000 verify reset" \
  -c "exit"
  ```

  Don't worry if you get an error on this step, you should be able to ignore it.

6. Once the command completes, hit the `RESET` button on your Xenon. After it reboots, the RGB LED will blink red and then turn Green. The blue D7 LED will remain on, and a new drive named `XENONBOOT` will show up on your computer. You can now unplug the Particle Debugger from your Xenon and computer an continue with the [Installing CirtcuitPython](#installing-circuitpython) steps below.

### Option 2: Burning a new Bootloader with the Segger J-Link

If you're using a Segger J-Link Debugger to burn a new bootloader, you'll first need to disable mass storage support. Then you'll erase the flash of the Xenon, and use `make` commands to flash the bootloader to your device.

#### Disable Mass Storage Support 

If this is your first time using the Segger J-Link for burning a bootloader, you'll want to disable Mass Storage support.

1. Open a terminal window and run the `JLinkExe` command, which was created when you installed the J-Link tools.

2. The first thing this command will do is update the firmware on your device. Once done, you'll be dropped into a `J-Link` prompt.

3. Type `MSDDisable` and hit enter. Then type `exit` and hit enter.

**Note**: If you ever need to re-enable Mass Storage support, you can do so with the `MSDEnable` command.

#### Build and Burn a new Bootloader

1.  Make sure you're still in the `Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader` directory and run the following command to erase the underlying Nordic chip on the Xenon. At this point, the RGB LED on your Xenon will stop blinking, which is expected as the Particle Bootloader and Device OS has been removed.

  ```bash
  nrfjprog -f nrf52 --eraseall
  ```

  ![](/assets/images/nrfjprog-flash.png)

2. Clean the build artifacts, and flash a new softdevice to the Xenon.

  ```bash
  make BOARD=particle_xenon clean
  make BOARD=particle_xenon sd
  ```

  ![](/assets/images/make-clean.png)

3. Burn a new bootloader with the flash command. This will take a few moments, and once done, the RGB LED will blink red and then turn Green. The blue D7 LED will remain on, and a new drive named `XENONBOOT` will show up on your computer. You can now unplug the J-Link Debugger from your Xenon and computer an continue with the [Installing CirtcuitPython](#installing-circuitpython) steps below.

  ```bash
  make BOARD=particle_xenon flash
  ```

## Installing CircuitPython

Once you've burned a new bootloader to your Xenonm and a `XENONBOOT` drive shows up on your machine, there are only a few steps left to get CircuitPython running on your device.

1. Download the latest version of CircuitPython for the Xenon from [here](https://circuitpython.org/board/particle_xenon/). We used the current stable version (4.1.2 at the time of writing), but you can try any beta versions available and those should work as well. 

2. Find the `.uf2` file you downloaded in the last step. Drag and drop it onto the `XENONBOOT` mount on your filesystem. 

The file will be copied and after a few seconds, your device will restart. The RGB LED will come on solid white and instead of a `XENONBOOT` mount, a mount named `CIRCUITPY` will show up on your machine. When you see that, you're all set to write CircuitPython code on your Xenon.

## Running CircuitPython Projects

To run CircuitPython on your Xenon, use any text editor of your choosing and create a new file in the `CIRCUITPY` mount called `code.py`. Whenever you save this file, your device will be restarted.

For example, here's a short snipped that blinks the built-in D7 LED on and off every half a second.

```python
import time
import board
from digitalio import DigitalInOut, Direction, Pull
 
led = DigitalInOut(board.BLUE_LED)
led.direction = Direction.OUTPUT
 
while True:
    led.value = False
    time.sleep(0.5)
    led.value = True
    time.sleep(0.5)
```
