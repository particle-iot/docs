# Particle Diagnostics

When IoT devices are deployed in the field, fleet managers
are immediately faced with this challenging question: **How do I ensure my devices are always online, and
happily communicating with the cloud?** After all, inherent in the
delivery on the promises of a connected product is the assumption that devices
are connected to the Internet and can share data successfully.

reliability of your IoT solution</p>

There are many obstacles that make achieving 100% uptime of an IoT
deployment very difficult,including:
- _Lack of physical access_: You can't rely on
in-person interactions with devices once they are deployed. Managing the
health of the device must be done entirely remotely.
- _Varying connectivity environments_: Devices can be deployed in
drastically different environments where access to connectivity (i.e.
cellular networks) can be poor or non-existent, depending on the conditions.
- _Interactions of complex systems_: The stack of IoT is quite wide,
and blends hardware &amp; software. For your system to be "up", each
layer in this stack must be behaving properly, while successfully
integrating with the broader IoT system.

Particle's all-in-one IoT platform is uniquely positioned to provide a
suite of diagnostics tools to help your team address these challenges.
These tools provide the visibility needed to actively monitor the health
of a device fleet, as well as equipping you with context needed to
quickly root cause and resolve issues when they arise.

**Particle Diagnostics** is comprised of two complimentary products to
maximize reliability of your IoT solution:
1. [**Device Vitals**](/tutorials/diagnostics/device-vitals): Deep
device-level visibility into a variety of connectivity vitals
that determine whether an individual device can communicate successfully.
2. [**Fleet Health**](/tutorials/diagnostics/fleet-health): System-wide
visibility into the state of an IoT fleet to monitor the overall health
of your deployment.
