# Tools and Features

This section of the guide will give you an overview of tools and features that you may need to use the Particle Platform.

This section is still under development! More specifics and guided tutorials coming soon.

We've ordered the sections in order of what we think will be most useful to the average user, but feel free to browse them in whatever order you'd like.

If this is your first time on the guide, we recommend that you browse through the [Getting Started](/guide/getting-started/intro) section to connect and learn about your device, then use this section to check out some of the tools that might be useful to you as you build and develop. When you're thinking about scaling, head over to [How to Build a Product with Particle](/guide/how-to-build-a-product/intro) for advice on taking your breadboard prototype to a scaled product.
