Our primary goal at Particle is to help product creators (engineers and entrepreneurs) bring new connected products to market.

This guide will teach you everything you need to transition from a breadboard prototype to a device manufactured at scale running on Particle's software platform. Many of the lessons within are broadly applicable to a wide range of products (whether they run on our platform or not). Other lessons are platform-specific. If you are an experienced engineer with manufacturing experience, some of these lessons will feel juvenile; if so, simply skip over the bits that you already know.

### But wait, I thought you were a hardware company?

Sort of. We're a software company that serves hardware companies. In order to most effectively deliver our software platform, we sell hardware (development kits and modules) that are pre-programmed with our software stack. All of our magic is in the software.

### Prerequisites

Before you start to follow this guide, you should already have:

- A functional prototype running on a Core, Photon, P0, P1, or Electron
- A working knowledge of Particle's development tools and cloud platform
- Created a [Product in the Console](/guide/tools-and-features/console)

If you are not yet familiar with these tools, please read the previous guides above (["Getting started"](/guide/getting-started/intro) and ["Tools and features"](/guide/tools-and-features/intro)).

### Steps to deliver a product on the Particle platform

At a high level, you should expect to follow these steps to transition from your first functional prototype to a mass-manufactured product:

- Set up your product in Particle's [Console](https://console.particle.io)
- Design your own printed circuit board (PCB)
- Build your own web app
- Build your own mobile apps (iOS and Android)
- Manufacture, program, and test devices

There are, of course, other issues you will likely encounter, such as injection molded plastic tooling, packaging, etc. This tutorial will focus strictly on electronics and software, as that is where the Particle platform is most relevant.

### What if I need help?

It takes a village to build a hardware product. It's uncommon for any company to try to do everything themselves; you will likely engage a variety of professional services firms or freelancers as you develop your product.

We are building a network of professional services firms who can support you with the following aspects of your product:

- Mechanical engineering
- Electrical engineering
- Firmware development
- Web development
- Mobile app development
- Contract manufacturing
- Packaging
- Logistics

If you are interested in engaging us or our partners to help develop your product, please contact [our sales team](https://www.particle.io/sales).
