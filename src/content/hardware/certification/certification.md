Connected devices nearly always require certifications that ensure they operate within the wireless transmission specifications determined by international regulatory bodies like the FCC and CE.

If you are looking for the actual certification document PDF files for Particle devices, see [certification documents](/hardware/certification/certification-documents/).

## RF certifications

Radio devices have a number of required certifications, depending on their use, frequency bands, etc.. 

### FCC (United States) - RF certifications

In the United States, FCC certifications for radio frequency devices are describes in FCC Part 15. It's further divided into unintentional radiators (subpart B) and intentional radiators (subpart C), which are discussed below.

Additionally, these resources can be helpful:

### CE (European Union) - RF certifications

In the European Union, this is often referred to as RED, Radio Equipment Directive 2014/53/EU. This is not a single certification, but
a collection of further certifications for specific types of devices and uses. Particle devices that can be deployed in the European
Union have the required RED certifications.

## Unintentional radiator certification

Almost all products will require unintentional radiator certification. This assures that your combined assembly of any custom parts plus the Particle device 
do not emit spurious electromagnetic radiation that would affect other electronic devices. 

Fortunately this is the least expensive and easiest certification. A certification house will operate your device and test for RF emissions. They will provide 
a document that you have passed the test. In the United States this is all you need; FCC unintentional radiator certification is a self-declared (by the 
certification house, not by you) and you don't need to file anything with the FCC. You don't get your own FCC ID, you use Particle's. This operates similarly
in Canada (ISED) and Europe (CE). This can be as low as US$ 1000 and can take as little as a few weeks.

The exception is all-in-one gateway devices like the Tracker One and Monitor One that are used with no attached external components; since the completed assembly 
has already been certified as a end-device, you can utilize the Particle certification and do not need to repeat unintentional radiator testing.

## Intentional radiator certification

If you use the same antenna as was used for the Particle certification, or a sufficiently similar one (as described below), you can often avoid having to do 
intentional radiator certification. Whenever possible, you should try to avoid intentional radiator as it's significantly more expensive and complicated. 
You should expect it to cost US$ 20000 to $ 30000 and may take 4 to 8 weeks.

The reason this certification is more expensive is that for cellular devices, it will test the output in every supported cellular band with your combination 
of Particle device and antenna. This requires a special test SIM and test firmware. 

For Wi-Fi devices this is done for every Wi-Fi band.

### Equal or lesser gain test

We highly recommend using the standard Particle antenna for your device. This is listed in the [antenna guide](/hardware/certification/antenna/).

In the United States, you can substitute an antenna, according to Title 47, Part 15, Section 15.204:

> Any antenna that is of the same type and of equal or less directional gain as an antenna that is
authorized with the intentional radiator may be marketed with, and used with, that intentional radiator.
No retesting of this system configuration is required. The marketing or use of a system configuration
that employs an antenna of a different type, or that operates at a higher gain, than the antenna
authorized with the intentional radiator is not permitted.

This is generally interpreted as equal or lesser gain in each frequency band that is supported, which can be significant because gain my vary between bands and a 
single higher-gain band may affect your ability to use a substitute antenna.

Additionally:

> (1) The antenna type, as used in this paragraph, refers to antennas that have similar in-band and out-of-band radiation patterns.

The process is similar in Canada and the European Union, but all of the uncertainty can be avoided by using the Particle certified antenna.

## Country-specific certifications

Some countries will allow common certifications like FCC (United States) or CE (European Union) to be used. For example, Australia and New Zealand.

Other countries require their own certification. Some examples include: Japan (JRL) and South Korea (KMC).

In the United Kingdom, CE (European Union) certification was previously allowed, but now a separate but similar UKCA certification is required. If you are planning to
sell your device in both the UK and Europe, you will need both certifications. Your certification house will typically complete both at the same time as they 
are quite similar.

Some countries require IMEI registration for cellular devices. In some cases, it can be done by end-users, and in others it must be done by the manufacturer.

## Cellular certifications

If you use the Particle SIM card, you generally do not need to worry about cellular certification as this is included.

If you are using a 3rd-party SIM card with devices that supports one, you may need to obtain cellular certification such as PTCRB in the United States and Canada, 
and GFC in Europe.

Additionally, some carriers may require additional certification to use their networks. For example, AT&T and Verizon in the United States require this
for LTE Cat M1 devices, but it is not required for devices with a Particle SIM card as it has already been completed.

### PTCRB - Cellular certifications

#### Module certification - PTCRB

This is the PTCRB certification level for cellular modules. The PTCRB defines a module in the following way:

> Modules are finished WWAN radio devices that do not directly connect to a host via a standardized external interface such as USB, PCMCIA, Compact Flash, MMC, RS-232, or IEEE-1394. A module may or may not include an integral antenna system or SIM/USIM interface.

The cellular modules used on Particle devices often provide this level of certification.

#### End Product certification - PTCRB

This is the PTCRB certification level for finished cellular products. End Products are defined as devices that meet all of the following attributes:

 - *Physical Interface* - If a physical control interface is required for the End Product, it shall utilize one of the following: USB, PCMCIA, Compact Flash, MMC, RS-232 (DE9), or IEEE-1394. No other physical control interfaces are acceptable.

 - *Power* - Obtains power from the standardized physical control interface or have a provisioned power source (i.e. dedicated battery, or a dedicated power source).
 - *UICC Interface* - Includes a fully self-contained USIM/SIM socket or embedded USIM/SIM
 - *Antenna* - Utilizes a self-contained antenna or provide an external antenna connector.
 - *Radio Access Technologies* - Covers at least one (1) comprehensive radio technology as specified by 3GPP for GERAN, UTRA, or E-UTRA devices

Particle devices that have PTCRB certification are end-products. Note, however, that EtherSIM devices are not PTCRB certified as it is not necessary for these devices.



## Safety certifications

### EN 62368-1

This is an international standard for equipment safety. It's used in the European Union, as well as in the United States by the UL.

Prior to 2020, the standard was EN 60950-1, but EN 62368-1 has completely replaced the earlier version.

### RF exposure limit certification

For general mobile devices, there are limits to the amount of RF exposure users of the device will incur.

In the United States, this is FCC Title 47, Chapter I, Subchapter A, Part 2, Subpart J, Radio frequency Radiation Exposure ยง 2.1091.

In the European Union, this is EN 62311.

Note that there is a separate certifications for wearable devices, and also for implanted medical devices. Particle devices are not
certified as either.

### UL (Underwriter's Laboratories)

UL (Underwriters Laboratories) is an American worldwide safety consulting and certification company. UL provides safety-related certification, validation, testing, inspection, auditing, advising, and training services to manufactures, retailers, policymakers, regulators, service companies, and consumers.

The majority of UL certifications, which can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UL_(safety_organization)#UL_Standards">here</a>, are standards for electrical and electronic products that utilize high voltage AC electricity for power. UL certification is typically not required for low voltage or battery powered products. 

This is one of the reasons many small electronic devices use an external or wall-mount transformer. Since the high voltage is isolated to the external power supply, only it needs to be UL certified, and that would be done by the power supply manufacturer.


### RoHS

In some cases, your completed assembly may require RoHS certification. This is a test to make sure your completed assembly does not 
contain prohibited materials. In some cases, your certification house will simply check the RoHS status of any components you use in your
design (printed circuit boards, components, connectors, etc.) to makes sure they are safe. In other cases, they will disassemble your device
and perform chemical tests on the components. 

RoHS is self-certified (by your certification house, not you), so you do not need to file this test with any authority, but it still may be required,
particularly in the EU.

### REACH

REACH is a European Union standard for chemicals used during the manufacture of your product. This will generally not be required, unless
you are manufacturing your device in Europe, or are importing a very, very large quantity of product.
