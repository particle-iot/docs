This guide discusses the minor changes required when moving from the B404X/B404/B402 (LTE Cat M1) to B504E (LTE Cat 1) 
in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

The B504E is a LTE Cat 1 cellular device for use in the Americas region, in particular the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

LTE Cat 1 offers better cellular coverage than LTE Cat M1 in some areas, and is also faster.

## Changes required

### Power

### Platform


## Additional features

### GNSS

The B504 (and B524) include optional GNSS (GPS) functionality. This requires an additional antenna.


## Changes not required

### Size

The outline of the SoM module is unchanged between all B-Series SoM modules.

The shield on the B504 is larger than the B404X/B404/B402 but this generally will not affect your design as the thickness of the SoM is unchanged.

The shield on the B504 is the same size as the B524/B523.


### Antennas

The cellular antenna for the B504 is the same as the 

### GPIO and ports

There are no changes the pins on the M.2 for ports and GPIO.


### Cellular providers

Particle EtherSIM on the B404X and B404 is identical the B504.
