This page covers hats used in home automation, environmental monitoring, or robotics.


## Pimoroni automation hat

This hat includes a large number of inputs and outputs. ([Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/automation-hat?variant=30712316554), [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3289)).

- 3 x 24V @ 2A relays (NC and NO terminals)
- 3 x 12-bit ADC @ 0-24V (Â±2% accuracy)
- 3 x 24V tolerant buffered inputs
- 3 x 24V tolerant sinking outputs
- 15 x channel indicator LEDs
- 1 x 12-bit ADC @ 0-3.3V (not available on Muon!)
- 3.5mm screw terminals

The [pinout](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/automation_hat) is as follows:

{{> api-helper-pins mappings="1=3V3,2=2V,6=GND,3=SDA,5=SCL,29=Output 1,31=Output 3,32=Output 2,33=Relay 1,35=Relay 2,36=Relay 3,37=Input 1,38=Input 2,40=Input 3" platform="Muon" style="columns=hat"}}

Note that both 3V3 (for logic) and 5V (for relays and LEDs) are used on this board. 

There are two chips connected by I2C on the hat:

| Chip    | Description | I2C Address |
| :------ | :--- | :--- |
| SN3218  | 18-channel LED driver | 0x54 |
| ADS1015 | Analog to digital converter | 0x48 |

### ADC - Pimoroni automation hat

ADC inputs 1 - 3 cannot be used on the Muon. The problem is that I2C Address 0x48 is used by both the ADS1015 on the automation hat as well as
the TMP112A temperature sensor on the Muon itself. These will conflict with each other, allowing neither to be used.

### Digital inputs - Pimoroni automation hat

Digital inputs Input 2 and Input 3 can be read using `digitalRead()`. The value will be `HIGH` or `LOW` (1 or 0, respectively).

Digital Input 1 cannot be read with Device OS 5.9.0 as it does not allow reading of pins from the I/O expander (IOEX_PB7) at this time.


### Digital outputs - Pimoroni automation hat

All three digital output can be used. Note that you must set the `pinMode` once (typically during setup) before you can use `digitalWrite`.

```cpp
pinMode(A0, OUTPUT);
digitalWrite(A0, HIGH);
```


### Relays - Pimoroni automation hat

All three relays can be activated using the GPIO in the table above. Note that you must set the `pinMode` once (typically during setup) before you can use `digitalWrite`.

```cpp
pinMode(D4, OUTPUT);
digitalWrite(D4, HIGH);
```
