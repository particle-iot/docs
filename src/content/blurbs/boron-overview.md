The Boron is the 3rd-generation cellular device in a prototyping form factor. It has pins on the bottom that can plug into a solderless breadboard, and is compatible with the Adafruit Feather form-factor to easily add accessories like sensors and displays. You can also plug it into a socket on a custom circuit board.

- Includes a built-in Particle SIM card ([free for use](/tutorials/device-cloud/introduction/#free-tier) up to certain limits, no credit card required).
- Can be powered by USB, rechargeable LiPo battery, or an external power supply (3.9 - 12 VDC).

The available models include:

| Model | Region | EtherSIM | Bands | Replacement |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| BRN404 | United States, Canada, Mexico | &check; | LTE Cat M1 | |
| BRN314 | Global<sup>1</sup> | &check; | LTE Cat M1 | |
| BRN402 | United States, Canada, Mexico | | 2G/3G | Use BRN404 instead |
| BRN310 | Global<sup>1</sup> | | 2G/3G | Use BRN314 instead |

- <sup>1</sup>Global except in areas that have or will soon discontinue the use of 2G/3G, including the United States.
- Do not deploy the BRN314 or BRN310 in the United States, see [2G/3G sunset](/tutorials/cellular-connectivity/introduction/#united-states).
- See the [Carrier List](/tutorials/cellular-connectivity/cellular-carriers/?tab=CountryDetails) for compatibility in specific countries.
