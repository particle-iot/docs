The B Series SoM (system-on-a-module) is similar to the Boron in that it is a 3rd-generation cellular device. It plugs into an M.2 NGFF connector on your custom circuit board and is intended for mass production use.

One of the benefits is that many of the extra features on the Boron have been omitted from the SoM, so you can implement a custom solution as necessary. For example, rather than duplicating the buttons and status LED on the SoM, you can put them on an external control panel for your product, or omit them entirely.

| Feature | Boron | B Series SoM | SoM Base Board | Tracker SoM |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| U.FL Antenna Connector | &check; | &check; | Optional |&check; | 
| MFF2 SMD Particle SIM<sup>2</sup> | &check; | &check; | &nbsp; |&check; | 
| Nano 4FF SIM card connector | &check; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| USB Connector | &check; | &nbsp; | Optional | Optional |
| Status LED | &check; | &nbsp; | Optional | Optional |
| Reset and Mode Buttons | &check; | &nbsp; | Optional | Optional |
| Battery Connector | &check; | &nbsp; | Optional | Optional |
| PMIC and Fuel Gauge<sup>1</sup> | &check; | &nbsp; | Optional | &check; | 

<sup>1</sup>The PMIC (power management IC) and fuel gauge are used with battery-powered applications. They're omitted from the SoM as they are not needed for externally powered solutions (grid or automotive power, for example). Additionally, you may want to use different models if you are making a solar-powered device, or using a different battery technology or multiple battery pack.

<sup>2</sup>The built-in Particle SIM card is [free for use](/tutorials/device-cloud/introduction/#free-tier) up to certain limits, no credit card required.
