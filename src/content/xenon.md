# Particle Xenon: Bluetooth + Mesh

![Image of the Xenon in a breadboard](/assets/images/xenon-breadboard-05.png)


The Xenon is a low cost mesh-enabled development kit that can act as either an endpoint or repeater within a Particle Mesh network.

Equipped with the Nordic nRF52840, the Xenon has built-in battery charging circuitry which makes it easier to connect a Li-Po battery and 20 mixed signal GPIOs to interface with sensors, actuators, and other electronics.

The Xenon is best for connecting sensors, motors, pumps, valves, and points of data-interest. Pair it with an Argon or Boron gateway to get all that great data into the Device Cloud.
