The Ethernet FeatherWing is the fastest way to add wired connectivity to your Argon or Boron and turns any Particle Gen 3 dev kit into an Ethernet gateway. Based on the WIZnet W5500 chip, this side-by-side FeatherWing maintains great RF performance even while adding Ethernet connectivity to any Particle Gen 3 device.
