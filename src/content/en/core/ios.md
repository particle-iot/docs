iOS Cloud SDK
=======

Particle iOS Cloud SDK enables iOS apps to interact with Particle-powered connected products via the Particle Cloud. Itâ€™s an easy-to-use wrapper for Particle REST API. The Cloud SDK will allow you to:

- Manage user sessions for the Particle Cloud (access tokens, encrypted session management)
- Claim/Unclaim devices for a user account
- Get a list of instances of user's Particle devices
- Read variables from devices
- Invoke functions on devices
- Publish events from the mobile app and subscribe to events coming from devices *(Coming Soon)*

All cloud operations take place asynchronously and use the well-known completion blocks (closures for swift) design pattern for reporting results allowing you to build beautiful responsive apps for your Particle products and projects.
iOS Cloud SDK is implemented as an open-source Cocoapod library. See [Installation](#ios-cloud-sdk-installation) section for more details. It works well for both Objective-C and [Swift](#support-for-swift-projects) projects.

Particle iOS Cloud SDK is available under the Apache License 2.0. See the [LICENSE file](https://github.com/spark/spark-sdk-ios/blob/master/LICENSE) for more info.

####Rebranding notice

Spark has been recently rebranded as Particle.
Code currently refers to `SparkCloud` and `SparkDevice`, this will soon be replaced with `ParticleCloud` and `ParticleDevice`. A new Cocoapod library will be published and current one will be depracated and point to the new one. This should not bother or affect your code.

## Installation

#### Install CocoaPods

Particle iOS Cloud SDK is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). Cocoapods is an easy to use dependacy manager for iOS.

If you do not yet have CocoaPods installed, go [here](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) to install it.

#### Install Particle SDK

To install the iOS Cloud SDK, simply add the following line to your Podfile on main project folder:

```ruby
pod "Spark-SDK"
```

and then run `pod update`.

A new `.xcworkspace` file will be created for you to open by Cocoapods. Open that file workspace file in XCode and you can start interacting with Particle cloud and devices by adding `#import "Spark-SDK.h"`. (that is not required for swift projects)

#### Support for Swift projects
To use iOS Cloud SDK from within Swift based projects [read here](http://swiftalicio.us/2014/11/using-cocoapods-from-swift/).

For a detailed step-by-step help on integrating the Cloud SDK within a Swift project check out this [Particle community posting](https://community.particle.io/t/mobile-sdk-building-the-bridge-from-swift-to-objective-c/12020/1).

The [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/InteractingWithObjective-CAPIs.html) is an important resource on mixing Objective-C and Swift code, be sure to read through that as well.

_Notice_ that we've included the required bridging header file in the SDK, you just need to copy it to your project add it as the active bridging header file in the project settings as described in the links above.
There's also an [example app](https://github.com/spark/spark-setup-ios-example), this app also demonstrates the Particle DeviceSetup library usage, as well as several Cloud SDK calls.

## Cloud SDK Usage

Cloud SDK usage involves two basic classes:

- `SparkCloud`: a singleton object that enables all basic cloud operations such as user authentication, device listing, claiming etc.
- `SparkDevice`: an instance represnting a claimed device in the current user session. Each object enables device-specific operation such as: getting its info, invoking functions and reading variables from it.

###Common tasks

Here are few examples for the most common use cases to get you started:

### Cloud Login
You don't need to worry about access tokens, SDK takes care of that for you

**Objective-C**
```objc
[[SparkCloud sharedInstance] loginWithUser:@"ido@particle.io" password:@"userpass" completion:^(NSError *error) {
    if (!error)
        NSLog(@"Logged in to cloud");
    else
        NSLog(@"Wrong credentials or no internet connectivity, please try again");
}];
```
---
**Swift**

```swift
SparkCloud.sharedInstance().loginWithUser("ido@particle.io", password: "userpass") { (error:NSError!) -> Void in
    if let e=error {
        println("Wrong credentials or no internet connectivity, please try again")
    }
    else {
        println("Logged in")
    }
}
```
---

### List Devices

List the devices that belong to currently logged in user and find a specific device by name:

**Objective-C**

```objc
__block SparkDevice *myPhoton;
[[SparkCloud sharedInstance] getDevices:^(NSArray *sparkDevices, NSError *error) {
    NSLog(@"%@",sparkDevices.description); // print all devices claimed to user

    for (SparkDevice *device in sparkDevices)
    {
        if ([device.name isEqualToString:@"myNewPhotonName"])
            myPhoton = device;
    }
}];
```
---
**Swift**

```swift
var myPhoton : SparkDevice?
SparkCloud.sharedInstance().getDevices { (sparkDevices:[AnyObject]!, error:NSError!) -> Void in
    if let e = error {
        println("Check your internet connectivity")
    }
    else {
        if let devices = sparkDevices as? [SparkDevice] {
            for device in devices {
                if device.name == "myNewPhotonName" {
                    myPhoton = device
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
---

### Read Variable
Assuming here that `myPhoton` is an active instance of `SparkDevice` class which represents a device claimed to current user:

**Objective-C**
```objc
[myPhoton getVariable:@"temperature" completion:^(id result, NSError *error) {
    if (!error) {
        NSNumber *temperatureReading = (NSNumber *)result;
        NSLog(@"Room temperature is %f degrees",temperatureReading.floatValue);
    }
    else {
        NSLog(@"Failed reading temperature from Photon device");
    }
}];
```
---

**Swift**
```swift
myPhoton!.getVariable("temperature", completion: { (result:AnyObject!, error:NSError!) -> Void in
    if let e=error {
        println("Failed reading temperature from device")
    }
    else {
        if let temp = result as? Float {
            println("Room temperature is \(temp) degrees")
        }
    }
})
```
---

### Call Function

Invoke a function on the device and pass a list of parameters to it, `resultCode` on the completion block will represent the returned result code of the function on the device

**Objective-C**
```objc
[myPhoton callFunction:@"digitalwrite" withArguments:@[@"D7",@1] completion:^(NSNumber *resultCode, NSError *error) {
    if (!error)
    {
        NSLog(@"LED on D7 successfully turned on");
    }
}];
```
---

**Swift**
```swift
let funcArgs = ["D7",1]
myPhoton!.callFunction("digitalwrite", withArguments: funcArgs) { (resultCode : NSNumber!, error : NSError!) -> Void in
    if (error == nil) {
        println("LED on D7 successfully turned on")
    }
}
```
---

### List Variables and Functions
Functions is just a list of names, variables is a dictionary in which keys are variable names and values are variable types:

**Objective-C**
```objc
NSDictionary *myDeviceVariables = myPhoton.variables;
NSLog(@"MyDevice first Variable is called %@ and is from type %@", myDeviceVariables.allKeys[0], myDeviceVariables.allValues[0]);

NSArray *myDeviceFunctions = myPhoton.functions;
NSLog(@"MyDevice first Function is called %@", myDeviceFunctions[0]);
```
---

**Swift**
```swift
let myDeviceVariables : Dictionary? = myPhoton.variables as? Dictionary<String,String>
println("MyDevice first Variable is called \(myDeviceVariables!.keys.first) and is from type \(myDeviceVariables?.values.first)")

let myDeviceFunction = myPhoton.functions
println("MyDevice first function is called \(myDeviceFunction!.first)")
```
---

### Get Device Instance
Get a device instance by its ID:

**Objective-C**
```objc
__block SparkDevice *myOtherDevice;
NSString *deviceID = @"53fa73265066544b16208184";
[[SparkCloud sharedInstance] getDevice:deviceID completion:^(SparkDevice *device, NSError *error) {
    if (!error)
        myOtherDevice = device;
}];
```
---

**Swift**
```swift
var myOtherDevice : SparkDevice? = nil
    SparkCloud.sharedInstance().getDevice("53fa73265066544b16208184", completion: { (device:SparkDevice!, error:NSError!) -> Void in
        if let d = device {
            myOtherDevice = d
        }
    })
```
---

### Rename a Device
you can simply set the `.name` property or use -rename() method if you need a completion block to be called (for example updating a UI after renaming was done):

**Objective-C**
```objc
myPhoton.name = @"myNewDeviceName";
```

_or_
```objc
[myPhoton rename:@"myNewDeviecName" completion:^(NSError *error) {
    if (!error)
        NSLog(@"Device renamed successfully");
}];
```
---

**Swift**
```swift
myPhoton!.name = "myNewDeviceName"
```
_or_
```swift
myPhoton!.rename("myNewDeviceName", completion: { (error:NSError!) -> Void in
    if (error == nil) {
        println("Device successfully renamed")
    }
})
```
---

### Logout
Also clears user session and access token

**Objective-C**
```objc
[[SparkCloud sharedInstance] logout];
```
---
**Swift**
```swift
SparkCloud.sharedInstance().logout()
```
---

### Events sub-system

You can make an API call that will open a stream of [Server-Sent Events (SSEs)](http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/). You will make one API call that opens a connection to the Particle Cloud. That connection will stay open, unlike normal HTTP calls which end quickly. Very little data will come to you across the connection unless your Particle device publishes an event, at which point you will be immediately notified. In each case, the event name filter is `eventNamePrefix` and is optional. When specifying an event name filter, published events will be limited to those events with names that begin with the specified string. For example, specifying an event name filter of 'temp' will return events with names 'temp' and 'temperature'.

#### Subscribe to events

Subscribe to the firehose of public events, plus private events published by devices one owns:

```objc
// The event handler:
SparkEventHandler handler = ^(SparkEvent *event, NSError *error) {
        if (!error)
        {
            dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
                NSLog(@"Got Event %@ with data: %@",event.event,event.data);
            });
        }
        else
        {
            NSLog(@"Error occured: %@",error.localizedDescription);
        }
        
    };
    
// This line actually subscribes to the event stream:
id eventListenerID = [[SparkCloud sharedInstance] subscribeToAllEventsWithPrefix:@"temp" handler:handler];
```
---

*Note 1:* Specifying `nil` or empty string in the `eventNamePrefix` parameter will subscribe to ALL events (beware: lots of data!).

*Note 2:* You can have multiple handlers per event name and/or same handler per multiple events names.

Subscribe to all events, public and private, published by devices the user owns:

```objc
id eventListenerID = [[SparkCloud sharedInstance] subscribeToMyDevicesEventsWithPrefix:@"temp" handler:handler];
```
---

Subscribe to events from one specific device (by deviceID, second parameter). If the API user owns the device, then he'll receive all events, public and private, published by that device. If the API user does not own the device he will only receive public events.

```objc
id eventListenerID = [[SparkCloud sharedInstance] subscribeToDeviceEventsWithPrefix:@"temp" deviceID:@"53ff6c065075535119511687" handler:handler];
```
---

other option is calling same method via the `SparkDevice` instance:

```objc
id eventListenerID = [device subscribeToEventsWithPrefix:@"temp" handler:handler];
```
---

this guarantees that private events will be received since having access device instance in your app signifies that the user has this device claimed.

#### Unsubscribing from events

Very straightforward. Keep the id object the subscribe method returned and use it as parameter to call the unsubscribe method:

```objc
[[SparkCloud sharedInstance] unsubscribeFromEventWithID:self.eventListenerID];
```
---

or via the `SparkDevice` instance (if applicable):

```objc
[device unsubscribeFromEventWithID:self.eventListenerID];
```
---

#### Publishing an event

You can also publish an event from your app to the Particle Cloud:

**Objective-C**

```objc
[[SparkCloud sharedInstance] publishEventWithName:@"event_from_app" data:@"event_payload" isPrivate:NO ttl:60 completion:^(NSError *error) {
    if (error)
    {
        NSLog(@"Error publishing event: %@",error.localizedDescription);
    }
}];
```
---

**Swift**

```swift
SparkCloud.sharedInstance().publishEventWithName("event_from_app", data: "event_payload", isPrivate: false, ttl: 60, completion: { (error:NSError!) -> Void in
    if let e = error
    {
        println("Error publishing event" + e.localizedDescription)
    }
})
```
---

### Additional reference
For additional reference check out the [Reference in Cocoadocs website](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/Spark-SDK/) for full coverage of `SparkDevice` and `SparkCloud` functions and member variables. In addition you can consult the javadoc style comments in `SparkCloud.h` and `SparkDevice.h` for each public method.
