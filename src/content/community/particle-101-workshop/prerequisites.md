To save time at the actual workshop, the following steps should ideally be completed beforehand.

1. Install the [Particle CLI](/getting-started/developer-tools/cli/) (Command Line Interface)
<br /><br />
2. Create a [Particle account](https://login.particle.io/signup) if you do not already have one.
<br /><br />
3. Install the Particle [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/particle-build-iot-projects-wifi-or-cellular/id991459054) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.particle.android.app) App.

**All done?** Now you are ready to dive in to the workshop.
