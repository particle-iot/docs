To save time at the actual workshop, the following steps should ideally be completed beforehand.

1. Install the [Particle CLI](/getting-started/developer-tools/cli/) (Command Line Interface)
<br /><br />
2. Create a [Particle account](https://login.particle.io/signup) if you do not already have one.
<br /><br />
3. Install the Particle <pbo;e App.

**All done?** Now you are ready to dive in to the workshop.
