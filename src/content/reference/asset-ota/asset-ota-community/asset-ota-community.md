## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute an Asset OTA community project: 

- Create your own Github repository to hold your text and images.
- Add your text to the default README.md file using [basic Github markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
- Add any images, either in the same directory as the README.md file, or in an `images` subdirectory. Use the `![alt text](image.png)` style of embedding images in your .md file.
- Avoid referencing images on external services.
- You can include a video, but you must be able to implement your integration without having to watch the video. You should externally host videos on YouTube or Vimeo on your channel. A video is optional.
- The documentation content at docs.particle.io is Apache 2 licensed, so submissions will have that license as well.
- Once your content is ready, send an email to docs-submission (at) particle.io.
