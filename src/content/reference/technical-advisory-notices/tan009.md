## What is happening?

Particle has identified an unarticulated, carrier-level network change that leads to intermittent increased connection times for some customers.

## Who is impacted?

This notice is specific to devices using the SARA-R410M LTE Cat M1 cellular modem: 

- E Series E402, E404, 
- Electron ELC402
- B Series SoM B402, B404
- Boron BRN402, BRN404

The following are **not** affected:

- BRN404X and B404X are not affected (has a SARA-R510 modem)
- Tracker One ONE402, ONE404 are not affected (has a BG96-MC modem)
- Tracker SoM T402, T404 are not affected (has a BG96-MC modem)
- All 2G/3G and LTE Cat 1 models are not affected (SARA-U201, SARA-U260, SARA-U270, SARA-G350, EG91-E, EG91-EX)

**This condition impacts customers who terminate connection attempts manually, e.g. using SEMI_AUTOMATIC or MANUAL mode, after a period of less than 10 minutes.** Customers who do not manually terminate connection attempts in firmware are significantly less impacted, though this issue can also be noticeable in time-sensitive operations.

A previous version of this statement said that EtherSIM devices were not affected. We have observed some impact after this statement was made.

We have not seen evidence that 2G/3G, or LTE Cat 1 devices are experiencing this issue.

## What is Particle doing about it?

Particle engineering leadership has sustained a highest-priority escalation, communicating our extensive research into device-side behavior through our close relationships with the affected partners and providers. 

At present, the Particle team is circling in on root cause. However, there is no ETA that can yet be offered. Particle is also actively engaged in pursuing a firmware workaround in parallel.

Updates will be communicated via [status.particle.io](http://status.particle.io) at very least once per day.

## What can we do to reduce impact?

If you are using `SEMI_AUTOMATIC` or `MANUAL` system mode and you have implemented a timer that terminates connection attempts after a given timespan (e.g. by calling a cellular disconnect or by calling system sleep), we recommend increasing the value of that timer to a value greater than 10 minutes. Not terminating a connection attempt at all will further reduce impact.
