## What is happening?

Particle has a identified an issue that can lead to lengthy or intermittent connectivity issues on a small number devices manufactured after July 2022:

- B Series SoM B402
- Boron LTE BRN402

There is a timing-related issue between the SIM card and the u-blox SARA-R410M modem that affects SIM card initialization. The cellular modem may recover after a power cycle, either by Device OS after 10 mins or through the customerâ€™s product or firmware. Devices impacted by this issue may see this problem intermittently.


## Who is impacted?

This notice is specific to Gen 3 devices using the SARA-R410M LTE Cat M1 cellular modem:

- B Series SoM B402
- Boron LTE BRN402

Only these models manufactured after July 2022 that have the SIM ICCID prefix 890103 are affected. The ICCID can be found in the SIM tab in the console if you've imported the devices. You can also connect the device by USB to your computer, put it in listening mode (blinking dark blue) by holding down the MODE button, and using the `particle identify` command in the Particle CLI.


The following are **not** affected:

- B Series Som B404 and B404X are not affected
- Boron LTE BRN404 and BRN404X are not affected
- Tracker One ONE402, ONE404 are not affected (has a BG96-MC modem)
- Tracker SoM T402, T404 are not affected (has a BG96-MC modem)
- Gen 2 devices (E Series LTE and Electron LTE) are not affected
- All 2G/3G and LTE Cat 1 models are not affected (SARA-U201, SARA-U260, SARA-U270, SARA-G350, EG91-E, EG91-EX)
- Device with EtherSIM are not affected


## What is Particle doing about it?

Particle expects to release an update to Device OS the week of November 7, 2022, with a software change to reduce this timing-related issue during SIM initialization.


## What can we do to reduce impact?

If possible, we recommend holding manufacturing on affected units until the updated version of Device OS is available. 

This update can be flashed through a conventional DeviceOS upgrade process. Any device that ultimately can connect could receive this patch via OTA.
