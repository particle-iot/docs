# {{title}}

This technical advisory notice is for the B404 (B-Series SoM with EtherSIM for NORAM). Devices manufactured after June, 2022, will ship with Device OS 2.3.0. 

This is a required update, and you will not be able to downgrade the devices to an earlier version due to a component change caused by supply chain constraints.

The following SKUs are affected:

| SKU | Description | Region | Lifecycle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| B404MEA | B-Series LTE CAT-M1 (NorAm), [x1] | NORAM | GA |
| B404MTY | B-Series LTE CAT-M1 (NorAm), Tray [x50] | NORAM | GA |

This does not affect the BRN404 (Boron with EtherSIM for NORAM), which will continue to ship with Device OS 2.2.0.

See [Manufacturing Firmware Versions](/scaling/manufacturing/manufacturing-firmware-versions/) for more information.
