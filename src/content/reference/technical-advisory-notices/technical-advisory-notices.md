## By product family

### Tracker System

- [TAN002 - Tracker One v1.0 Shipping Mode](/reference/technical-advisory-notices/tan002-tracker-one-v10-shipping-mode/) Shipping mode issue impacting Tracker One v1.0 devices manufactured before August 31, 2020.
- [TAN006 - Tracker SoM GNSS Interface](/reference/technical-advisory-notices/tan006-tracker-som-gnss-interface/)
- [TAN011 - Tracker SoM default application firmware issue](/reference/technical-advisory-notices/tan011/)
- [TAN013 - Tracker Manufacturing Firmware 3.3.0](/reference/technical-advisory-notices/tan013/)

### Boron/B-Series SoM

- [TAN001 - SARA-R410M "124-day"](/reference/technical-advisory-notices/tan001-sara-r410m-124-day/) Power-off procedure recommendations for Particle devices running u-blox SARA-R410M-02B modules
- [TAN003 - B402 RF Circuit Component](/reference/technical-advisory-notices/tan003-b402-rf-circuit-component/) A manufacturing run of B402 SOMs in week 28 of 2020 mis-populated 10K resistors in place of 15pF capacitors in the RF matching circuit. This can lead to weakened connectivity and component heating.
