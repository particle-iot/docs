## particle list

Generates a list of what devices you own, and displays information about their status, including what variables and functions are available

```sh
# how to show what devices of yours are online
# and what functions and variables are available
$ particle list

Checking with the cloud...
Retrieving devices... (this might take a few seconds)
my_device_name (0123456789ABCDEFGHI) 0 variables, and 4 functions

    int digitalWrite(string)
    int digitalRead(string)
    int analogWrite(string)
    int analogRead(string)

```

## particle device add

  Adds a new device to your account.
  
  Your device will need to be connected to the Internet (onboard LED breathing cyan) for this process to work.

```sh
# how to add a new device to your account
$ particle device add 0123456789ABCDEFGHI
Claiming device 0123456789ABCDEFGHI
Successfully claimed device 0123456789ABCDEFGHI
```


## particle device rename

  Assigns a new name to a device you've claimed

```sh
# how to change the name of your device
$ particle device rename 0123456789ABCDEFGHI "pirate frosting"
```



## particle device remove

  Removes a device from your account so someone else can claim it.

```sh
# how to remove a device from your account
$ particle device remove 0123456789ABCDEFGHI
Are you sure?  Please Type yes to continue: yes
releasing device 0123456789ABCDEFGHI
server said  { ok: true }
Okay!
```


## particle flash

  Sends a firmware binary, a source file, or a directory of source files, or a known app to your device.

### Flashing a directory

  You can setup a directory of source files and libraries for your project, and the CLI will use those when compiling remotely.  You can also create ```particle.include``` and / or a ```particle.ignore``` file in that directory that will tell the CLI specifically which files to use or ignore.

```sh
# how to compile and flash a directory of source code to your device
$ particle flash 0123456789ABCDEFGHI my_project
```

### Flashing one or more source files

```sh
# how to compile and flash a list of source files to your device
$ particle flash 0123456789ABCDEFGHI app.ino library1.cpp library1.h
```

### Target a specific firmware version for flashing

You can compile and flash your application against a specific firmware version using the `--target` flag. If you don't specify `target` your code will compile against the latest released firmware.

This is useful if you are not ready to upgrade to the latest system firmware on your device or if you want to try a pre-release version.

```sh
# compile your application with the 0.5.0 system firmware and flash it
$ particle flash --target 0.5.0 0123456789ABCDEFGHI my_project
```

### Compiling remotely and flashing locally

To work locally, but use the cloud compiler, simply use the compile command, and then the local flash command after.  Make sure you connect your device via USB and place it into [DFU mode](/guide/getting-started/modes/#dfu-mode-device-firmware-upgrade-).

```sh
# how to compile a directory of source code and tell the CLI where to save the results
$ particle compile photon my_project_folder --saveTo firmware.bin
OR
# how to compile a list of source files
$ particle compile photon app.ino library1.cpp library1.h --saveTo firmware.bin

# how to flash a pre-compiled binary over usb to your device
# make sure your device is flashing yellow and connected via USB
# requires dfu-util to be installed
$ particle flash --usb firmware.bin
```


## particle compile

  Compiles one or more source file, or a directory of source files, and downloads a firmware binary.

  **NOTE**: Remember that **\*.cpp** and **\*.ino** files behave differently. You can read more about it on our [support page](http://support.particle.io/hc/en-us/articles/204952620).

```text
This is device specific and must be passed as an argument during compilation.

The devices available are:

- photon (alias is 'p')
- core (alias is 'c')

eg. `particle compile photon xxx` OR `particle compile p xxxx` both targets the photon
```

### compiling a directory

  You can setup a directory of source files and libraries for your project, and the CLI will use those when compiling remotely.  You can also create ```particle.include``` and / or a ```particle.ignore``` file in that directory that will tell the CLI specifically which files to use or ignore.  Those files are just plain text with one line per file name

```sh
# how to compile a directory of source code
$ particle compile photon my_project_folder
```

### example particle.include

  The particle.include and particle.ignore files are just regular text files with one file name per line.  If your directory has one of these files, the CLI will use it to try and determine what to include or ignore when compiling your app.

```text
# particle.include
application.cpp
library1.h
library1.cpp
```

### example particle.ignore

```text
# particle.ignore
.ds_store
logo.png
old_version.cpp
```


### Compiling one or more source files

```sh
# how to compile a list of source files
$ particle compile photon app.ino library1.cpp library1.h
```

### Target a specific firmware version for compiling

You can compile your application against a specific firmware version use the `--target` flag. If you don't specific `target` your code will compile against the latest released firmware.

This is useful if you are not ready to upgrade to the latest system firmware on your device.

```sh
# compile your application with the 0.5.0 system firmware
$ particle compile photon --target 0.5.0 my_project
```


## particle call

  Calls a function on one of your devices, use ```particle list``` to see which devices are online, and what functions are available.

```sh
# how to call a function on your device
$ particle call 0123456789ABCDEFGHI digitalWrite "D7,HIGH"
1
```



## particle get

  Retrieves a variable value from one of your devices, use ```particle list``` to see which devices are online, and what variables are available.

```sh
# how to get a variable value from a device
$ particle get 0123456789ABCDEFGHI temperature
72.1
```

## particle webhook create

Create a webhook that will trigger an HTTP request when a Particle event is published to the cloud. You can pass in an `eventName`, `url`, and `deviceID`
as arguments to the CLI command. Optionally, you can create your own custom JSON file that includes webhook params. For a full list of available
webhook parameters, see the [REST API documentation](/reference/api/#create-a-webhook). This command is only available for user webhooks.

```sh
$ particle webhook create temperature https://mysite.com
$ particle webhook create temperature https://mysite.com 0123456789ABCDEFGHI
$ particle webhook create webhook.json
```

```sh
# An example custom webhook JSON file that will target Librato, webhook.json
{
    "event": "librato_",
    "url": "https://metrics-api.librato.com/v1/metrics",
    "requestType": "POST",

```


## particle keys doctor

Helps you update your keys, or recover your device when the keys on the server are out of sync with the keys on your device.  The ```particle keys``` tools requires both dfu-util, and openssl to be installed.

Connect your device in [DFU mode](/guide/getting-started/modes/#dfu-mode-device-firmware-upgrade-), and run this command to replace the unique cryptographic keys on your device.  Automatically attempts to send the new public key to the cloud as well.

```sh
# helps repair key issues on a device
$ particle keys doctor 0123456789ABCDEFGHI
```


## particle keys new

Generates a new public / private key pair that can be used on a device.

```sh
# generates a new public/private keypair
$ particle keys new
running openssl genrsa -out device.pem 1024
running openssl rsa -in device.pem -pubout -out device.pub.pem
running openssl rsa -in device.pem -outform DER -out device.der
New Key Created!

# generates a new public/private keypair with the filename mykey
$ particle keys new mykey
running openssl genrsa -out mykey.pem 1024
running openssl rsa -in mykey.pem -pubout -out mykey.pub.pem
running openssl rsa -in mykey.pem -outform DER -out mykey.der
New Key Created!
```

## particle keys load

Copies a ```.DER``` formatted private key onto your device's external flash.  Make sure your device is connected and in [DFU mode](/guide/getting-started/modes/#dfu-mode-device-firmware-upgrade-).  The ```particle keys``` tools requires both dfu-util, and openssl to be installed.  Make sure any key you load is sent to the cloud with ```particle keys send device.pub.pem```

```sh
# loads a key to your device via USB
# make sure your device is connected and blinking yellow
# requires dfu-util
$ particle keys load device.der
...
Saved!
```

## particle keys save

Copies a ```.DER``` formatted private key from your device's external flash to your computer.  Make sure your device is connected and in [DFU mode](/guide/getting-started/modes/#dfu-mode-device-firmware-upgrade-).  The ```particle keys``` tools requires both dfu-util, and openssl to be installed.

```sh
# creates a backup of the private key from your device to a file
# requires dfu-util
$ particle keys save device.der
...
Saved!
```

## particle keys send

Sends a device's public key to the cloud for use in opening an encrypted session with your device.  Please make sure your device has the corresponding private key loaded using the ```particle keys load``` command.

```sh
# sends a new public key to the API for use for your device
$ particle keys send 0123456789ABCDEFGHI device.pub.pem
submitting public key succeeded!
```

## particle keys server

Switches the server public key stored on the device's external flash.  This command is important when changing which server your device is connecting to, and the server public key helps protect your connection.   Your device will stay in DFU mode after this command, so that you can load new firmware to connect to your server.

Coming Soon - more commands to make it easier to change the server settings on your device!


```sh
# changes the public server key stored on your device
# (useful when switching servers)
$ particle keys server my_server.der
Okay!  New keys in place, your device will not restart.
```

# Libraries

## Overview

The CLI supports using libraries with your project. This allows you to incorporate already written and tested code 
into your project, speeding up development and assuring quality. If you are using a library in your project, 
you are a library consumer, and when you develop a new library for yourself, or for others to use, you are a library contributor. Both of these roles are described in the following sections.

## Consuming Libraries

The overall flow when consuming a library goes like this

- setting up the initial project for your application
- finding the library you want to add `particle library search`
- adding the library to your project - `particle library add`
- editing your source code to use the library
- compiling your project - `particle compile` 

These commands are described in detail below.

### Project structure

Libraries are available for use in your project when the project conforms to the extended project structure:

- there is a `project.properties` file in the root of the project
- application sources are placed in a `src` folder

### library search

The `library search` command allows you to search for libraries that are related to the text that you type in. 

For example,

```
particle library search neop
```

Will find libraries containing `neop` in their name. Each library is returned in the format `name@version`. 

To see additional details for each library, append `-v` to the command line.

```
particle library search neop -v
```

This command displays a short description of each library as well. 

### library add

The `library add` command adds the latest version of a library to your project. 

For example, if you wanted to add the neopixel library to your project, you would type

```
particle library add neopixel
```

This will add the neopixel dependency to your project's `project.properties` file. 

The neopixel library itself is not present in your project, so you won't see the neopixel sources. 
The library is added to your project when the project is compiled in the cloud.
 
### Library copy

Adding a library to your project does not add the library sources. For times when you want to access the library sources,
such as when making changes to an existing library, you can have them added locally. 

To add the library locally, add the `--copy` flag to the `library add` command:

```
particle library copy neopixel
```



### Incorporating the library into your project

Once the library is added, it is available for use within your project. 
The first step to using the library is to include the library header, which follows the name of the library. For example:

```
#include "neopixel.h"
```

The functions and classes from that library are then available for use in your application. 
Check out the library examples and documentation that comes with the library for specifics on using that library.



## Contributing Libraries

Contributing a library is the process where you author a library and share this with the community. 

The steps to creating a library are as follows:

- optionally, create a project for consuming the library
- scaffold a new library structure - `library init`
- author the library, tests and examples
- publish the library

### Create a project for consuming the library

While it's not structly necessary to have a project present when authoring
a new library, having one can help ensure that the library works as intended before publishing it. The project allows you to consume the library, check that it compiles and verify it behaves as expected on the target platforms before publishing.

For the library consumer project that will consume the library `mylib`, create an intiial project structure tha looks like this:

```
src/project.cpp
src/project.h
project.properties
lib/mylib
```

The library will exist in the directory `lib/mylib`. 

All these files are initially empty - we'll add content to them as the library is authored. 


### Scaffolding the library

The `library init` command is used to scaffold the library. It creates a skeleton structure for the library, containing 
initial sources, examples, tests and documentation. 

In our example project structure we want to create a new library in `lib/mylib` so we will run these commands:

```
cd lib/mylib
particle library init
```
The command will prompt you to enter the name of the library - `mylib`, the version - `0.0.1` and the author, your name/handle/ident. 

The command will then create the skeleton structure for the library. 


### Authoring the library

You are then free to edit the `.cpp` and `.h` files in the `lib/mylib/src` folder to provide the functionality of your library. 

It's a good idea to test often, by writing code in the consuming project that uses each piece of functionality in the library as it's written. 

### Consuming the library

To test your changes in the library, compile the project using `particle compile <platform>`

`particle compile photon`

This will create a `.bin` file which you then flash to your device. 

`particle flash mydevice firmware.bin`

(Replace the name `firmware.bin` witht the name of the `.bin` file produced by the compile step.)

### Contributing the library

Once you have tested the library and you are ready to upload the library to the cloud, you run the `library contribute`
command.  You run this command from the directory containing the library

```
cd lib/mylib
particle library contribute
```

Before the library is contributed, it is first validated. If validation succeeds, the library is contributed 
and is then available for use in your other projects. The library is not available to anyone else.

### Publishing the Library

If you wish to make a contributed library available to everyone, it first needs to be published.

When publishing a library, it's important to ensure the version number hasn't been published before - 
if the version has already been published, the library will not be published and an error message will be displayed. 

Incrementing the version number with each publish is a recommended approach to ensuring unique versions. 

Once the library is published, it is visible to everyone and available for use. Once the a given version of a library
has been published, the files and data cannot be changed. Subsequent changes must be via a new contributed version
and subsequent publish.
