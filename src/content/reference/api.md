# Particle Cloud API

The Particle Cloud API is a [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) API.
REST means a lot of things, but first and foremost it means that we use the URL in the way that it's intended:
as a "Uniform Resource Locator".

In this case, the unique "resource" in question is your device (Spark Core, Photon, Electron).
Every device has a URL, which can be used to `GET` variables, `POST` a function call, or `PUT` new firmware.
The variables and functions that you have written in your firmware are exposed as *subresources* under the device.

All requests to the device come through our API server using TLS security.

```
PROTOCOL AND HOST
"https://api.particle.io"
```

*Formatting note:* When we write something prefixed with a colon `:`, we mean you should substitute your own information.
For example when you see something like `/v1/devices/:deviceId`
you might code something like `/v1/devices/55ff8800beefcafe12345678`.

## Authentication

Just because you've connected your Particle device to the internet doesn't mean anyone else should have access to it.
Permissions for controlling and communciating with your Particle device are managed with OAuth2.

```bash
# You type in your terminal
curl https://api.particle.io/v1/devices/0123456789abcdef01234567/brew \
     -d access_token=9876987698769876987698769876987698769876
# Response status is 200 OK, which means
# the device says, "Yes ma'am!"

# Sneaky Pete tries the same thing in his terminal
curl https://api.particle.io/v1/devices/0123456789abcdef01234567/brew \
     -d access_token=1234123412341234123412341234123412341234
# Response status is 403 Forbidden, which means
# the device says, "You ain't the boss of me."

# LESSON: Protect your access token.
```

Your access token can be found in the Particle Build web IDE on the 'Settings' page.

[Particle Build >](https://build.particle.io)

When you connect your Particle device to the Cloud for the first time, it will be associated with your account,
and only you will have permission to control your Particle deviceâ€”using your access token.

If you need to transfer ownership of the device to another user, the easiest way is to simply log into the [Particle build site](https://build.particle.io), click on the 'Devices' drawer on the bottom left, and then click the small 'right arrow' by the device you want to release, then click "Remove Device". This will make it possible for the other person you are transferring the device to, to go through the normal [claiming process](/guide/getting-started/start).

In the future, you will be able to provision access to your Particle device to other accounts
and to third-party app developers; however, these features are not yet available.



### How to send your access token

There are three ways to send your access token in a request.

* In an HTTP Authorization header (always works)
* In the URL query string (only works with GET requests)
* In the request body (only works for POST & PUT when body is URL-encoded)

In these docs, you'll see example calls written using a terminal program called
[curl](http://curl.haxx.se/)
which may already be available on your machine.

Example commands will always start with `curl`.

---

To send a custom header using curl, use you the `-H` flag.
The access token is called a "Bearer" token and goes in the standard
HTTP `Authorization` header.

``` bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer 38bb7b318cc6898c80317decb34525844bc9db55"
  https://...
```

---

The query string is the part of the URL after a `?` question mark.
To send the access token in the query string just add `access_token=38bb...`.
Because your terminal thinks the question mark is special, we escape it with a backslash.

``` bash
curl https://api.particle.io/v1/devices\?access_token=38bb7b318cc6898c80317decb34525844bc9db55
```

---

The request body is how form contents are submitted on the web.
Using curl, each parameter you send, including the access token is preceded by a `-d` flag.
By default, if you add a `-d` flag, curl assumes that the request is a POST.
If you need a different request type, you have to specifically say so with the `-X` flag,
for example `-X PUT`.

``` bash
curl -d access_token=38bb7b318cc6898c80317decb34525844bc9db55
  https://...
```

## OAuth Clients

An OAuth client generally represents an app.
The Particle CLI is a client, as are Particle Build, the Particle iOS app, and
the Particle Android app. You too can create your own clients.
You should create separate clients for each of your web and mobile apps that hit
the Particle API.

Some requests, like generating an access token, require you to specify an OAuth
client ID and secret using HTTP Basic authentication. Normally, when calling the
Particle API as a single developer user to access your own account, you can use
`particle` for both the client ID and secret as in the example above for
[generating an access token](#generate-an-access-token).

```bash
curl -u particle:particle https://...
```

However, especially when you are *creating a product* on the Particle platform
and your web app needs to hit our API on behalf of your customers, you need to
create your own client.

*NEVER expose the client secret to a browser.*
If, for example, you have a client that controls all your organization's
products, and you use the client secret in front-end javascript, then a
tech-savvy customer using your website can read the secret in her developer
console and hack all your customers' devices.

## Errors

The Particle Cloud uses traditional HTTP response codes to provide feedback from the device regarding the validity
of the request and its success or failure. As with other HTTP resources, response codes in the 200 range
indicate success; codes in the 400 range indicate failure due to the information provided;
codes in the 500 range indicate failure within Particle's server infrastructure.

```html
200 OK - API call successfully delivered to the device and executed.

400 Bad Request - Your request is not understood by the device, or the requested subresource (variable/function) has not been exposed.

401 Unauthorized - Your access token is not valid.

403 Forbidden - Your access token is not authorized to interface with this device.

404 Not Found - The device you requested is not currently connected to the cloud.

408 Timed Out - The cloud experienced a significant delay when trying to reach the device.

500 Server errors - Fail whale. Something's wrong on our end.
```

## Versioning

The API endpoints all start with `/v1` to represent the first official version of the Particle Cloud API.
The existing API is stable, and we may add new endpoints with the `/v1` prefix.

If in the future we make backwards-incompatible changes to the API, the new endpoints will start with
something different, probably `/v2`.  If we decide to deprecate any `/v1` endpoints,
we'll give you lots of notice and a clear upgrade path.
