## Introduction

[Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) is an open-source visual programming tool. Particle created the **Particle IoT Rules Engine**, based on Node-RED, hosted on Particle's servers, and included the custom Particle node for interacting with the Particle Cloud API and devices.

We've now [open-sourced the Particle node](https://github.com/particle-iot/node-red-contrib-particle-official) allowing anyone to use these features on their own cloud-hosted or locally-hosted Node-RED installation. 

The Particle-hosted Rules Engine has been discontinued and the Particle node is now a community-supported project.

---

The Node-RED is an **IF**/**THEN** workflow builder specifically
designed for IoT data. It lets anyone on your team easily create conditional
business logic using a visual interface.

<img src="/assets/images/rules-engine/intro.png" class="full-width"/>

Node-RED can trigger activities in the cloud based on something
that is happening in a device's environment. That is:

**IF** certain conditions are met in the _physical world_, **THEN** take an
action in the _digital world_.

Some of the specific ways you could use the Node-RED in this way include:
- Notify a device owner when sensor readings leave a healthy
range
- Open a new case in your CRM of choice when a hardware component stops
functioning
- Alert your on-call engineers when the error rate of your fleet exceeds
a certain threshold

The opposite goal can also be achieved:

**IF** certain conditions are met in the _digital world_, **THEN** take
an action in the _physical world_.

Some of the specific ways you could use the Node-RED in this way include:

- Send an over-the-air firmware update to a device when it has been
added to a [device group](/getting-started/console/device-groups/)
- Activate certain features of your product when customer payment
information is collected
- Disable access to using a broken device when a service-person is
en-route to fix it

## Key Terms
There are some key terms that will help you get started with the Rules
Engine:

### Nodes
<img src="/assets/images/rules-engine/node.png" class="small"/>

The building blocks of the Node-RED are called **nodes**. Each node
represents a distinct piece of logic and has a well-defined purpose:
it gets some data, does something with that data, and then passes that data on.

There are many different types of nodes that carry out specific
functions. Each node can be configured with pre-defined properties to
work to your specifications.

There are 3 main types of nodes:
- **Input nodes** that inject data into a flow. These nodes are placed
at the beginning of a flow and trigger flow execution.
- **Output nodes** that send data out of a flow. These nodes are place
at the end of a flow.
- **Processing nodes** that receive data from the previous node, execute
some logic, then send the result onto the next node. These nodes are
place in the middle of a flow.

### Flows

<img src="/assets/images/rules-engine/flow.png"/>

Multiple nodes are connected to one another, creating networks called **flows**.
The flow is responsible for moving data between the nodes.

If nodes are the building blocks of the Node-RED, flows are the
end-products. They represent the combination of many pieces of logic
into an end-to-end workflow.

You can import, export, and share flows with other users, as well.

### Palette

The "menu" of available nodes available to you when assembling flows is
known as a **palette**. From the palette, you can drag nodes onto the
workspace and incorporate them into a flow.

### Message

Node-RED executes a flow by passing **messages** from node to
node. These messages are simple objects that always have an ID, and
often also have a set of associated properties.

In Node-RED, a message object is normally referred to as `msg`.
Associated properties are most commonly stored in `msg.payload`.

## Getting Started

Let's get you up and running with Node-RED. You can either run it using a cloud service, or run it locally on your computer.

- [Using a Cloud Service](#using-a-cloud-service)
- [Running Locally](#running-locally)

## Using a Cloud Service

There are a number of cloud services that support Node-RED, however the most convenient is the IBM Cloud. There's built-in support for deploying Node-RED, and you can do so in the free plan for simple flows. 

- [Official Node-RED Instructions](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/ibmcloud) for IBM Cloud.
- [A helpful article](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-securely-host-node-red-in-cloud-for-free-and-safely-expose-it-to-the-internet-over-https-hw5d3220) about setting up IBM Cloud.
- Or, if you prefer, instructions for using [AWS](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/aws) or [Microsoft Azure](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/azure).

### Using IBM Cloud

The [Node-RED IBM Cloud Instructions](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/ibmcloud) are quite complete, but the basic process is:

- Sign up for a free [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com) account if you do not already have one. No credit card is required to start.

- After signing in create a **Create Resource +**, the blue button in the upper-right corner of the window. 

![Create Resource](/assets/images/rules-engine/create-resource.png)

- Search for **node-red**:

![Create Resource](/assets/images/rules-engine/search-node-red.png)

- Select the **Node-RED App**:

![Create Resource](/assets/images/rules-engine/node-red-app.png)

- Click **Get Started**. You can usually use the default settings and just select **Create** in the next page.

![Create App](/assets/images/rules-engine/create-app.png)

- In the **Services** panel, the status will be **Provisioning service credentials** for a few minutes.

![Provisioning service credentials](/assets/images/rules-engine/provisioning-service-credentials.png)

- When complete you can proceed to the next step by clicking the blue **Deploy your app** button on the right side to being deployment. You don't need to add services to it first; the Node-RED app itself contains everything you need to run it. 

![Create Progress](/assets/images/rules-engine/create-deploy-app.png)

- Select **Cloud Foundry** as the Deployment target if not already selected.

![Deployment Target](/assets/images/rules-engine/deployment-target.png)

- Create an API Key using the **New** button. The rest of the setting defaults are usually fine. Click **Next**.

![Create API Key](/assets/images/rules-engine/create-api-key.png)
 
- You can use the default settings for **Configure the DevOps toolchain** then click **Create**.

![Create Devops Toolchain](/assets/images/rules-engine/create-devops.png)

- It will take a few minutes to deploy. The progress is shown in the **Delivery Pipelines** panel. It may be **No Stages Detected** for a minute before switching to **In progress** for a few minutes. When it reaches **Success** you can proceed to the next step.

![Create Pipeline](/assets/images/rules-engine/create-pipeline.png)

- Click the **Open Dashboard** link in **Services**.

![Open Dashboard](/assets/images/rules-engine/open-dashboard.png)

- In the Dashboard, click **Connections** in the left-hand menu. Note the URL under **Route**. If you selected the default settings it should be something like `https://node-red-<something>.mybluemix.net/`. Note that you need to use this URL, not the external endpoint URL in the Overview page.

![Route URL](/assets/images/rules-engine/connection-route.png)

- Open the Route URL and follow the steps to configure and secure your Node-RED installation. Make sure you set a strong password as anyone can get to your cloud-hosted Node-RED installation if they know the URL.

![Cloud Configuration 1](/assets/images/rules-engine/cloud-configure-1.png)

![Cloud Configuration 2](/assets/images/rules-engine/cloud-configure-2.png)

![Cloud Configuration 3](/assets/images/rules-engine/cloud-configure-3.png)

![Cloud Configuration 4](/assets/images/rules-engine/cloud-configure-4.png)

- Once you've secured your installation, you'll be at the home page. Click the **Go to your Node-RED flow editor** button to begin.

![Cloud Home](/assets/images/rules-engine/cloud-home.png)

- Then follow the instructions below for [Getting started with Node-RED](#getting-started-with-node-red) to add the Particle Node to your instance and begin creating workflows.

## Running Locally

It's also possible to run Node-RED on your own computer, either natively or in a Docker container.

- [In a Docker container](#running-locally-docker)
- [Native installation](#running-locally-native)

If you are running Node-RED locally, you generally do not need to open firewall ports. The Particle cloud connection for subscribe is outgoing TLS/SSL (port 443), which allows the cloud to send data to Node-RED without firewall modifications. 

If you want to access the Node-RED flow editor (port 1880) or dashboard from outside your local network you would need to configure port forwarding for most home networks. However, be sure to require logging in if you enable access!

### Running Locally - Docker

[The Node-RED Docker instructions](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/docker) are a good place to start.

Using Docker is especially convenient since it's less likely to be affected by node.js versions and such. Once you've installed Docker, it can be as easy as:

- Make a named data volume to hold the Node-RED data. The second command lists all volumes so you can verify that it was created. You should only do this once; you can create and destroy containers and keep your data volume, which contains your flows, so you won't lose those.

```
$ docker volume create --name node_red_user_data
$ docker volume ls
```

And then build the container and run it:

```
$ docker run -it -p 1880:1880 -v node_red_user_data:/data --name mynodered nodered/node-red
```

And then open it in your browser: [http://127.0.0.1:1880/](http://127.0.0.1:1880/)!

Follow the instructions below for [Getting started with Node-RED](#getting-started-with-node-red) to add the Particle Node to your instance and begin creating workflows.

To detach the session from your terminal, type ctrl-p ctrl-q and the container will continue to run in the background.

To reattach to the terminal run:

```
$ docker attach mynodered
```

If you need to restart the container, such as after a reboot or restart of the Docker daemon:

```
$ docker start mynodered
```

And stop it:

```
docker stop mynodered
```

And delete it:

```
docker rm mynodered
```

### Running Locally - Native

This method is also a good way to run Node-RED on a **Raspberry Pi**, allowing you to use an inexpensive Raspberry Pi as your Node-RED server!

[The Node-RED local install documentation](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/local) is a good place to start.

For Mac and Linux, it may be as easy as:

```
$ sudo npm install -g node-red
```

To start:

```
$ node-red
```

The data directory should be **.node-red** in your home directory.

To connect to the server open it in your browser: [http://127.0.0.1:1880/](http://127.0.0.1:1880/).

Follow the instructions below for [Getting started with Node-RED](#getting-started-with-node-red) to add the Particle Node to your instance and begin creating workflows.

For Windows, the process is similar; just leave out the sudo.

To uninstall:

```
$ sudo npm uninstall -g node-red
```


## Getting started with Node-RED

After connecting your Node-RED instance in your web browser you'll see a window like this. Depending on the service you used, there may be additional nodes in the palette or in your first flow already.

<img src="/assets/images/rules-engine/node-red-default.png"
class="full-width"/>

On the left, you'll see the [palette](#palette) of nodes available to
you. Nodes in the palette are categorized, and can be filtered using the
search box above the palette pane.

On the right-hand side of the screen, you'll notice an info pane that
can provide you with context and instructions as you build flows. By
default, you will see metadata on the flow you're currently working on,
including its name and ID. The right pane can also be toggled from
_info_ to _debug_, which can provide helpful debugging information.

The majority of the screen is dedicated to your flow-builder.
Drag-and-drop any node onto the grid to incorporate it into a flow. Your
flow is given a default name of "Flow 1." Double-click the tab at the
top of the flow builder to rename it at any time. You can also click on
the **+** button in the top-right corner of the flow builder to create
new flows.

### Adding the Particle Node

Since presumably you're wanting to use this with Particle devices, you'll want to install the Particle node.

- Click the **hamburger icon** in the upper right (1), then select **Manage Palette** (2).

![Rules Manage Palette](/assets/images/rules-engine/manage-palette.png)

- In the **User Settings** window in the **Palette** tab, select **Install** (1) then enter the name, like **particle** in the search box (2). Then add the **@particle/node-red-contrib-particle-official** node by clicking **Install** (3).

![Rules Install](/assets/images/rules-engine/install.png)

- The Particle nodes will appear at the bottom of the palette:

![Particle Nodes](/assets/images/rules-engine/particle-nodes.png)


### Hello World Flow

We can start with the simplest flow possible: injecting some data in,
and logging it out using the debug node.

First, find the **inject node** in your palette on the left pane. The
inject node does what you would expect — injects a message to initiate
a flow. The message can take on different flavors, like a piece of
text, a number, a timestamp, or a more complex structured data object.

Drag the inject node onto your flow builder grid. You should see the
right pane change to include information about the inject node.

<img src="/assets/images/rules-engine/inject-node.png"
class="full-width"/>
<p class="caption">Click and drag the inject node onto the grid
to add it to your flow</p>

By default, the inject node will initiate a flow with a timestamp. Double
click on the inject node to customize its behavior. Let's inject the
current time at an interval of every 5 seconds as shown below:

<img src="/assets/images/rules-engine/inject-node-config.png" />

Click **Done** to save the node and return to the flow builder. Nice!
You've added your first node. You'll notice that the inject node has a
blue dot in the top-right corner. This means that there have been
changes to this node that need to be deployed (more on that later).

Next, find the green **debug node** and drag that onto the grid. Note
the node connectors on the right edge of the inject node, and the left edge
of the debug node. Connect the inject node to the debug node by drawing
a line from one node connector to the other with your mouse. This is the
method by which you connect nodes to one another to allow them to pass
data through the flow.

<img src="/assets/images/rules-engine/first-flow.png" />
<p class="caption">Nodes are connected to one another to pass data
through the flow</p>

In order to the flow to begin running, you must **deploy** it. Deploying
the flow saves any pending changes and begins processing inbound
messages. Whenever there are pending changes, the deploy button will
illuminate in the nav bar.

Click the deploy button to get our Hello World flow up and running:

<img src="/assets/images/rules-engine/deploy-button.png"
class="full-width"/>
<p class="caption">Deploy flows to begin processing messages and pick up
on any pending changes</p>

You should receive notification that your flow has been successfully
deployed. In addition, the blue dots have disappeared, suggesting the
pending changes have been deployed.

At the top of the right pane, click on the **debug tab**. Voila! You
should see a new up-to-date timestamp added to the debug logs every 5
seconds.

<img src="/assets/images/rules-engine/debug-tab.png" />

At any time, you can click on the trash can icon to clear the debug log.
You can also filter the logs to all nodes, selected nodes, or the
current flow.

Note that the debug pane is actually logging `msg.payload`. The
timestamp is being attached to the `payload` key of the message
object. This method of accessing properties of a message using
`msg.[property]` is a very common nomenclature in the Node-RED.

Congrats! You've built your first flow successfully.

### Adding Nodes to Your Palette

Beyond the nodes included with the default palette, you have the ability
to install a variety of open-source nodes that have been contributed to
Node-RED by the community.

There are thousands of community-contributed nodes and flows that
extend the capability of the Node-RED. Many of these nodes provide
integrations with 3rd-party tools and services.

To explore the library of open-source nodes available to you, click on
&nbsp;<i class="ion-navicon-round"></i> > **Settings** in the top nav bar.

From here, click **Palette**, then the **Install** tab. You now can
search the library of nodes to find the one that suits your needs:

![](/assets/images/rules-engine/expand-palette.png)

When you find the node you're looking for, click the **install** button
to add it to your palette. You will need to confirm this action.

A table of the nodes that were installed with the Particle Rules Engine by default can be [found below](#nodes-in-particle-rules-engine).

## The Particle Nodes

The Particle Nodes include:

- **publish** - Publish an event to the Particle cloud. Useful for sending to devices.
- **subscribe** - Receive events from the Particle cloud. Useful for getting data from devices.
- **variable** - Retrieve a variable from a specific device.
- **function** - Make a function call on a specific device. Useful for affecting a change on one device.
- **particle api** - Make any Particle API call.

To add the nodes you need into your new Node-RED instance, click the **hamburger icon** in the upper right (1), then select **Manage Palette** (2).

![Rules Manage Palette](/assets/images/rules-engine/manage-palette.png)

In the **User Settings** window in the **Palette** tab, select **Install** (1) then enter the name, like **particle** in the search box (2). Then add the **@particle/node-red-contrib-particle-official** node by clicking **Install** (3).

![Rules Install](/assets/images/rules-engine/install.png)

In order to use the Particle Nodes you will need to first set up authentication.

### Setting up Authentication

The Particle Nodes will need access to your Particle account in order to interact with your devices.

- Log into [the console](https://console.particle.io). 
- Select **Authentication** (1)
- Click **New Client** (2)

![](/assets/images/rules-engine/create-client.png)

- In the **New OAuth Client** window, select **Two-Legged Auth (Server)**
- Enter a name. I called mine **Rules Engine**.

![](/assets/images/rules-engine/new-client.png)

- Copy the Client ID (rulesengine-2316 in my example)
- Copy the Client Secret. Note that this should be kept secret, and this is the only chance you have to copy it. Once you close this window you can't get the secret back!

![](/assets/images/rules-engine/copy-secret.png)

### Setting up a debugging subscription flow

We'll be using a **subscribe** node. This allows Node-RED to listen for Particle events posted by devices in your account. 

This is the flow we'll be creating in this section:

![](/assets/images/rules-engine/debug-node.png)

- In the Rules Engine, from the **Particle** section of the palette, drag a **subscribe** node to the flow. You'll notice it has an red triangle, so it needs to be configured. 

![](/assets/images/rules-engine/drag-subscribe.png)

- Click the pencil icon to **Add Particle config**.

![](/assets/images/rules-engine/add-particle-config.png)

- Enter your Client ID and Client Secret from the console into the Particle config window.

![](/assets/images/rules-engine/particle-config.png)

- Fill in the rest of the subscribe node configuration. 
- Set **Name** and **Event** to "LevelAlarm".
- Leave the **Device** field blank. 
- The **Scope** should be be left the default of **User**.

![](/assets/images/rules-engine/subscribe-config.png)

- From the **Output** section of the palette, drag a **debug** node next to your **subscribe** node.
- Then click on one of the handles and drag to the other to connect them.

![](/assets/images/rules-engine/debug-node.png)

- Click the Deploy button to start your flows running.
- View the **Debug** tab on the right hand side of the Rules Engine.

- Send an event using the Particle CLI, or from the [console](https://console.particle.io)

```
particle publish "LevelAlarm" "3.0" --private
```

![](/assets/images/rules-engine/debug-output2.png)

### Exporting Your Rules

To export your rules from the Particle Rules Engine:

- Log into your Rules Engine instance.

- Select the **Hamburger Menu** in the upper right corner of the window (1). Then **Export** (2). Then **Clipboard** (3).

![Rules Export](/assets/images/rules-engine/export.png)

- From the **Export to nodes Clipboard** window, you'll probably want to select **All Flows**, or if you only want some, individually select and save the flows you want to keep.

![Rules Export Clipboard](/assets/images/rules-engine/export-clipboard.png)

- Open your use Node-RED instance and select **Hamburger Menu** then **Import**. You can import directly from the clipboard or save to a file first.

Note: The exported rules contain any passwords you saved when you configured your nodes, along with the secret for your Particle authentication. Keep this secure.
