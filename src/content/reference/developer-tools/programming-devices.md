This document includes tips for installing a specific version of Device OS, typically during manufacturing, but can also be used for developer devices and testing.

There are a number of components that may need to be upgraded on a device, in addition to user firmware:

| Device | Generation | System Parts | Bootloader | Soft Device | NCP |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Tracker | Gen 3 | 1 | &check; | &check; | &check;<sup>2</sup> |
| B Series SoM | Gen 3 | 1 | &check; | &check; | &nbsp; |
| Boron | Gen 3 | 1 | &check; | &check; | &nbsp; |
| Argon | Gen 3 | 1 | &check; | &check; | &check;<sup>1</sup> |
| E Series | Gen 2 | 3 | &check; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| Electron | Gen 2 | 3 | &check; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| P1 | Gen 2 | 2 | &check; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| Photon | Gen 2 | 2 | &check; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |

<sup>1</sup>There is only one version of the Argon NCP firmware in production, so it does not need to upgraded.

<sup>2</sup>The Tracker SoM NCP firmware was upgraded in Device OS 3.0.0, thus there are two versions in the field. It is not necessary or desirable to ever downgrade the Tracker NCP firmware, as the 3.0.0 version is backward compatible with earlier versions. See [Argon and Tracker NCP](/reference/developer-tools/jtag/#argon-and-tracker-ncp) for more information.

There are a number of ways the Device OS version can be upgraded:

## OTA (over-the-air)

OTA is how most devices are upgraded in the field. This can also be done during manufacturing, either on the manufacturing line, or by the initial user, however it's more common to upgrade using one of the other methods, below, especially for cellular devices.

OTA will only ever upgrade the Device OS version; it will not downgrade. Device OS is generally backward compatible. If you built your user firmware targeting, say, 1.5.2, it would likely run correctly on Device OS 2.1.0. However, because of differences between versions, this is not always possible. Thus if you are relying on OTA, it is possible that devices from the factory could contain a newer version than you initially developed for.

## USB (particle update)

Using the `particle update` command in the Particle CLI is the most common way that end-users upgrade their devices, however there are a number of caveats:

- The version that is installed by the update command is built into a specific version of the CLI. In the absence of updating the CLI, it will always install that version, even if there is a newer version available. However, for manufacturing, this is likely the behavior that you want.
- The latest in the LTS branch (2.x, for example) is installed by the latest version of the CLI.
- The feature branch (3.x, for example) is never installed by the CLI. Thus if you require Device OS 3.x, then you cannot use the `particle update` method.
- The NCP (network coprocessor) is not upgraded by `particle update`. This currently only affects Tracker One/Tracker SoM devices being upgraded to Device OS 3.0.0 or later.

### Installing a specific version of the CLI

It's recommended that you first install the current version of the CLI using the [CLI installer](/getting-started/developer-tools/cli/). This is necessary to make sure the application dependencies such as dfu-util are installed, as well as any required device drivers for Windows and a udev rule for Linux.

Then locate the version of the CLI you want in the [particle-cli GitHub releases](https://github.com/particle-iot/particle-cli/releases). For example, if you wanted Device OS 1.5.2, you'd want particle-cli v2.6.0. Expand **Assets** and download the .zip or .tar.gz for the source and extract it.

From the Terminal or Command Prompt window, `cd` into the directory and install dependencies. For example:

```
cd ~/Downloads/particle-cli-2.6.0
npm install
```

To run commands using this specific version of the Particle CLI, instead of using the `particle` command, instead use `npm start` in this directory with the same command line options. For example:

```
npm start version
npm start help
npm start login
npm start list
npm start update
```

## USB (Particle CLI, manually)

It is also possible to use the Particle CLI to manually program the device, which provides the most flexibility at the expense of a more complicated script. The recommended flow is:

- The device should be in listening mode (blinking dark blue). If not, use `particle usb start-listening`.
- You may want to capture the Device ID and ICCID using `particle identify`.
- Flash the bootloader using `particle flash --serial`.
- Flash the NCP (Tracker with 3.x only) using `particle flash --serial`.
- Put the device in DFU mode (blinking yellow) using `particle usb dfu`.
- Flash the SoftDevice (Gen 3 only) using `particle flash --usb`.
- Program system-parts in numerical order using `particle flash --usb`
- Program the user firmware using `particle flash --usb`
- Mark setup done (Gen 3 running Device OS 3.x or earlier) using `particle usb setup-done`

You can download the necessary files for several common Device OS releases as a zip file for several common Device OS releases here:

{{device-restore mode="zip"}}

It is recommended that you use the latest in release line. For example, if you are using 1.5.x, use 1.5.2 instead of 1.5.0. Ideally, you should be using the latest LTS release (2.1.0, for example), unless you need features in a developer preview release (3.1.0, for example).

All versions are available in [GitHub Device OS Releases](https://github.com/particle-iot/device-os/releases).

| File | Generation | Listening | DFU |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Bootloader | All | &check; | <sup>1</sup> |
| NCP | Gen3 | &check; | &nbsp; |
| SoftDevice | Gen3 | &check; | &check;<sup>2</sup> |
| System Parts | All | &check; | &check;<sup>2</sup> |
| User Firmware | All | &check; | &check;<sup>2</sup> |

<sup>1</sup> It's technically possible to flash the bootloader in DFU mode, however the process is complicated. [Device Restore over USB](/tools/device-restore/device-restore-usb/) uses this technique, however the CLI only supports this during `particle update` and not when manually flashing the bootloader. It requires two dfu-util commands that vary between devices and resetting the device.

<sup>2</sup> While it's possible to flash system parts in listening mode (--serial), using DFU mode is generally more reliable. If you are downgrading in --serial mode, there are also additional restrictions, as the system parts must be flashed in reverse numerical order. Also, you can run into a situation where the device reboots too early in --serial mode, and completes the upgrade OTA, which defeats the purpose of flashing over USB first.


## USB (web-based)

[Device Restore - USB](/tools/device-restore/device-restore-usb/) is a convenient way to flash a specific version of Device OS, bootloader, SoftDevice, and user firmware onto a device over USB. It's normally used for individual developers, not manufacturing.

- There is limited browser support on desktop: Chrome, Opera, and Edge. It does not work with Firefox or Safari. Chrome is recommended.
- It should work on Chromebook, Mac, Linux, and Windows 10 on supported browsers.
- It does not require any additional software to be installed, but does require Internet access to download the requested binaries.


## USB (dfu-util)

It is possible to directly script the dfu-util application to flash system parts and user firmware. However, this is not usually an ideal solution is that you can't easily flash the bootloader using dfu-util, and the commands are complicated. Also, without the Particle CLI, you'd have to manually switch the device modes between DFU and listening mode using buttons, which is tedious at best.


## SWD/JTAG

SWD/JTAG is the recommended method for upgrading (or downgrading) Device OS, bootloader, Soft Device, and user firmware on devices where it is available. It requires a compatible SWD/JTAG programmer:

| Programmer | Gen 2 | Gen 3 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Particle Debugger | &check; | &check; |
| Segger J/LINK | &check; | &check; |
| ST-LINK/V2 | &check; | &nbsp; |


### Device compatibility - SWD/JTAG

The Tracker SoM does not contain a 10-pin SWD debugging connector on the SoM itself, but is exposed on the pads of the SoM and the connector could be added to your base board.

The 10-pin SWD debugging connector Tracker One is not easily accessible, as it not only requires opening the case, which would void the warranty and possibly affect the IP67 waterproof rating, but also the connector is not populated on the board (there are bare tinned pads where the SMD connector would be).

The B Series SoM does not contain the 10-pin SWD debugging connector on the SoM. There are pads on the bottom of the SoM that mate with pogo pins on the B Series evaluation board, which does have a 10-pin SWD debugging connector. You can either temporarily mount the SoM in a test fixture with a debugging connector, include the connector on your board, or use other methods.

The Boron and Argon both have 10-pin SWD debugging connectors on the Feather device.

The Electron, E Series, Photon and P1 have SWD on pins D7, D5, and optionally RESET. If these pins are available, you can program it by SWD. However, you may need to be able to change the device mode, so access to the MODE button, or to USB, may be helpful.

### Hex files

If you want to use SWD/JTAG see the [JTAG Reference](/reference/developer-tools/jtag/). The most common method is to generate an Intel Hex File (.hex) containing all of the binaries, including your user firmware binary. 

Using the [Hex File Generator](/tools/developer-tools/hex-generator/), you can take one of the base restore images, replace Tinker with your own user firmware, and download the resulting hex file. This makes it easy to flash devices with known firmware quickly and easily.

This is an excellent option if your contract manufacturer will be programming your devices as they will likely be able to use the .hex files and a SWD/JTAG programmer to easily reprogram your devices. This can be done with the standard JTAG programmer software and does not require the Particle toolchains or Particle CLI be installed.
