## Hardware products

_Longevity commitment_

Particle provides an explicit minimum longevity commitment for a subset of its hardware products, mostly enterprise-class SKUs, as described below. In the case that a particular product is not covered by this longevity commitment, please contact the Particle sales team for support.

Upon changing the lifecycle status of a hardware SKU from GA or NRND to Deprecated, Particle will notify customers and provide the following commitment through the transition from Deprecated to End of Support:

* **One year between Deprecation and Last Buy date**, defined as the last date that Particle will accept POs and forecasts for affected hardware.
* **Two years between Deprecation and Last Ship date**, defined as the last date that Particle will fulfill orders placed prior to the Last Buy Date. Note that all orders for affected products forecasted for delivery after the Last Buy Date are non-cancellable and non-returnable (NCNR).
* **Three years between Deprecation and End of Support** **date,** where ongoing support of affected products has ended and hardware support and warranties have expired.

**Note** that in case of significant volume decrease, unexpected changes to component availability from upstream suppliers, or technology/manufacturing changes, a switch to a comparable product could be decided by Particle who will notify customers using the standard Particle product/process change policy (PCN).
