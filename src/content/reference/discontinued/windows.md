# {{title}}

The Windows SDK consists of two parts: (1) the Cloud SDK and (2) the Device Setup library, the first is an API wrapper that enables your mobile app to interact with internet-connected hardware through the Particle Device Cloud while the latter is a library allows you to easily create a setup wizard for allowing your app users to setup their devices.

## Windows Cloud SDK

### Introduction

Particle Windows Cloud SDK enables Windows apps to interact with Particle-powered connected products via the Particle Device Cloud. It's an easy-to-use wrapper for Particle REST API. The Cloud SDK will allow you to:

- Manage user sessions for the Particle Device Cloud (access tokens, encrypted session management)
- Claim/Unclaim devices for a user account
- Get a list of instances of user's Particle devices
- Read variables from devices
- Invoke functions on devices
- Publish events and subscribe to events coming from devices

All cloud operations take place asynchronously and return a *System.Threading.Tasks.Task* allowing you to build beautiful responsive apps for your Particle products and projects. Windows Cloud SDK is implemented as an open-source .NET Portable Class Library. See [Installation](#installation) section for more details. It works well for both C# and VB projects.

[The code for the Windows Cloud SDK is available on GitHub.](https://github.com/particle-iot/particle-windows-sdk)

### Beta notice

This SDK is still under development and is currently released as Beta and over the next few months may go under considerable changes. Although tested, bugs and issues may be present. Some code might require cleanup. In addition, until version 1.0 is released, we cannot guarantee that API calls will not break from one Cloud SDK version to the next. Be sure to consult the [Change Log](https://github.com/particle-iot/particle-windows-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for any breaking changes / additions to the SDK.

### Getting started

- Perform the installation step described under the [Installation](#installation) section below for integrating in your own project
- Be sure to check [Usage](#usage) before you begin for some code examples

### Usage

Cloud SDK usage involves two basic classes: first is [`ParticleCloud`](https://github.com/particle-iot/particle-windows-sdk/blob/master/ParticleSDK/ParticleCloud.cs) which is an object that enables all basic cloud operations such as user authentication, device listing, claiming etc. Second class is [`ParticleDevice`](https://github.com/particle-iot/particle-windows-sdk/blob/master/ParticleSDK/ParticleDevice.cs) which is an instance representing a claimed device in the current user session. Each object enables device-specific operation such as: getting its info, invoking functions and reading variables from it.

### SDK calls from the UI thread

Some calls from the SDK can both update properties or run callbacks on a non UI thread (e.g. Events). If your application has a UI thread make sure to set the `SynchronizationContext`.

```cs
ParticleCloud.SharedCloud.SynchronizationContext = System.Threading.SynchronizationContext.Current;
```
---

### Common tasks

Here are few examples for the most common use cases to get your started:

#### Log in to Particle Device Cloud

You don't need to worry about access tokens and session expiry, SDK takes care of that for you.

```cs
var success = await ParticleCloud.SharedCloud.LoginAsync("user@example.com", "myl33tp4ssw0rd");
```
---

#### Log in to Particle Device Cloud with a token and validate

```cs
var success = await ParticleCloud.SharedCloud.TokenLoginAsync("d4f69e3a357f78316d50e76dbf10fe92364154bf");
```
---

#### Injecting an access token (app utilizes two legged authentication)

```cs
var success = await ParticleCloud.SharedCloud.SetAuthentication("d4f69e3a357f78316d50e76dbf10fe92364154bf");
```
---

#### Get a list of all devices

List the devices that belong to currently logged in user and find a specific device by name:

```cs
ParticleDevice myDevice = null;
List<ParticleDevice> devices = ParticleCloud.SharedCloud.GetDevicesAsync();
foreach (ParticleDevice device in devices)
{
  if (device.Name().equals("myDeviceName"))
    myDevice = device;
}
```
---

#### Get device instance by its ID or name

```cs
ParticleDevice device = ParticleCloud.SharedCloud.GetDeviceAsync("e9eb56e90e703f602d67ceb3");
```
---

#### Read a variable from a Particle device

Assuming here that `myDevice` is an active instance of `ParticleDevice` class which represents a device claimed to current user.

```cs
var variableResponse = myDevice.GetVariableAsync("temperature");
int temperatureReading = (int)variableResponse.Result;
```
---

#### Call a function on a Particle device

Invoke a function on the device and pass a parameter to it, the returning `ParticleFunctionResponse` will represent the returned result data of the function on the device.

```cs
int functionResponse = myDevice.RunFunctionAsync("digitalwrite", "D7 HIGH"));
int result = functionResponse.ReturnValue;
```
---

#### List device exposed functions and variables

`ParticleDevice.Functions` returns a list of function names. `ParticleDevice.Variables` returns a dictionary of variable names to types.

```cs
foreach (string functionName in myDevice.Functions)
  Debug.WriteLine($"Device has function: {functionName}");

foreach (varvariable in myDevice.Variables)
  Debug.WriteLine($"Device has variable: '{variable.Key}' of type '{variable.Value}'");
```
---

#### Rename a device

Set a new name for a claimed device:

```cs
myDevice.RenameAsync("myDeviceNew");
```
---

#### Refresh a device

Refreshes all the locally stored properties from the cloud and physical device (if online):

```cs
myDevice.RefreshAsync();
```
---

#### Log out

Log out the user, clearing their session and access token:

```cs
ParticleCloud.SharedCloud.LogOut();
```
---

### Events sub-system
You can make an API call that will open a stream of [Server-Sent Events (SSEs)](http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/). You will make one API call that opens a connection to the Particle Device Cloud. That connection will stay open, unlike normal HTTP calls which end quickly. Very little data will come to you across the connection unless your Particle device publishes an event, at which point you will be immediately notified. In each case, the event name filter is `eventNamePrefix` and is optional. When specifying an event name filter, published events will be limited to those events with names that begin with the specified string. For example, specifying an event name filter of 'temp' will return events with names 'temp' and 'temperature'.

#### Subscribe to events

Subscribe to the firehose of public events, plus private events published by devices one owns:

```cs
private void onEvent(object sender, ParticleEventResponse particeEvent)
{
  Debug.WriteLine($"Got Event {particeEvent.Name} with data {particeEvent.Data}");
}

Guid eventListenerID = ParticleCloud.SharedCloud.SubscribeToAllEventsWithPrefixAsync(onEvent, "temp");
```
---

*Note:* specifying null or empty string in the `eventNamePrefix` parameter will subscribe to ALL events (lots of data!) You can have multiple handlers per event name and/or same handler per multiple events names.

Subscribe to all events, public and private, published by devices the user owns:

```cs
Guid eventListenerID = ParticleCloud.SharedCloud.SubscribeToDevicesEventsWithPrefixAsync(handler, "temp");
```
---

Subscribe to events from one specific device. Pass a `PaticleDevice` or `deviceId` string as a second parameter. If the API user owns the device, then all events, public and private, published by that device will be received. If the API user does not own the device only public events will be received.

```cs
Guid eventListenerID = ParticleCloud.SharedCloud.SubscribeToDeviceEventsWithPrefixAsync(handler, myDevice);
```

```cs
Guid eventListenerID = ParticleCloud.SharedCloud.SubscribeToDeviceEventsWithPrefixAsync(handler, "e9eb56e90e703f602d67ceb3");
```
---

The method `SubscribeToDeviceEventsWithPrefixAsync` can also be called on a `ParticleDevice` instance, guaranteeing that private events will be received since having access device instance in your app signifies that the user has this device claimed.

```cs
Guid eventListenerID = myDevice.SubscribeToDeviceEventsWithPrefixAsync(handler, "temp");
```
---

#### Unsubscribing from events

Very straightforward. Keep the id object the subscribe method returned and use it as parameter to call the unsubscribe method:

```cs
ParticleCloud.SharedCloud.UnsubscribeFromEvent(eventListenerID);
```

or via the `ParticleDevice` instance (if applicable):

```cs
myDevice.UnsubscribeFromEvent(eventListenerID);
```
---

#### Publishing an event

You can also publish an event from your app to the Particle Device Cloud:

```cs
ParticleCloud.SharedCloud.PublishEventAsync("event_from_app", "event_payload", true, 60);
```
---

### OAuth client configuration

If you're creating an app you're required to provide the `ParticleCloud` class with OAuth clientId and secret. Those are used to identify users coming from your specific app to the Particle Device Cloud. Please follow the procedure described [in our guide](/reference/device-cloud/api/#create-an-oauth-client) to create those strings.

Once you've created your OAuth credentials, you can supply them to the SDK by providing them as string resources in a string resource file called "OAuthClient.resw", using the names `OAuthClientID` and `OAuthClientSecret` and they'll be picked up by the SDK automatically:

```xml
<data name="OAuthClientID" xml:space="preserve">
  <value>(client ID string goes here)</value>
</data>
<data name="OAuthClientSecret" xml:space="preserve">
  <value>(client secret 40-char hex string goes here)</value>
</data>
```
---

## Particle Device Setup library *(Alpha)*

### Introduction

The Particle Device Setup library *(Alpha)* is meant for integrating the initial setup process of Particle devices in your app. This library will enable you to easily invoke a standalone setup wizard UI for setting up internet-connected products powered by a Particle device (Photon, P0, P1). The setup UI can be easily customized by a customization proxy class, that includes: look & feel, colors, texts and fonts as well as custom brand logos and custom instructional video for your product. There are good defaults in place if you don't set these properties, but you can override the look and feel as needed to suit the rest of your app.

The wireless setup process for the Photon uses very different underlying technology from the Core. Where the Core used TI SmartConfig, the Photon uses what we call "soft AP" - i.e.: the Photon advertises a Wi-Fi network, you join that network from your mobile app to exchange credentials, and then the Photon connects using the Wi-Fi credentials you supplied.

With the Device Setup library, you make one simple call from your app, for example when the user hits a "Setup my device" button, and a whole series of screens then guide the user through the setup process. When the process finishes, the app user is back on the screen where she hit the "Setup my device" button, and your code has been passed an instance of the device she just setup and claimed. Windows Device setup library is implemented as an open-source .NET Portable Class Library. It works well for both C# and VB projects.

[The code for the Windows Device Setup library is available on GitHub.](https://github.com/particle-iot/particle-windows-devicesetup)

### Alpha notice

This Library is still under development and is currently released as Alpha and over the next few months may go under considerable changes. Although tested, bugs and issues may be present. Some code might require cleanup. In addition, until version 1.0 is released, we cannot guarantee that API calls will not break from one version to the next. Be sure to consult the [Change Log](https://github.com/particle-iot/particle-windows-devicesetup/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for any breaking changes / additions to the library.

### Getting started

- Perform the installation step described under the [Installation](#installation) section below for integrating in your own project
- Be sure to check [Usage](#usage) before you begin for some code examples

### Usage

Due to limitations on how string resources are handled in a PCL (Portable Class Library) you will need to inject the resources from the setup library into your app:

```cs
UI.WindowsRuntimeResourceManager.InjectIntoResxGeneratedApplicationResourcesClass(
  typeof(Particle.Setup.SetupResources)
);
```
---

You can either do this on app startup, or before you start the soft AP process.

If you are developing an application for Windows Phone, you will need to handle the hardware back buttons.

Define BackPressed EventHandler:

```cs
void HardwareButtons_BackPressed(object sender, BackPressedEventArgs e)
{
  if (SoftAP.SoftAPResult.Result != SoftAPSetupResult.Started)
  {
    HardwareButtons.BackPressed -= hardwareButtonsBackPressed;
    if (SoftAP.SoftAPResult.Result != SoftAPSetupResult.NotStarted)
      return;
  }
  
  if (Frame.CanGoBack)
  {
    e.Handled = true;
    Frame.GoBack();
  }
}
```
---

and before calling `SoftAP.Start()`:

```cs
HardwareButtons.BackPressed += hardwareButtonsBackPressed;
```
---

You will need to create an instance of the `SoftAPSettings` class to pass to `SoftAP.Start()`:

And populate the following required properties:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `AppFrame` | The main application frame |
| `CompletionPageType` | The page to show after completion |
| `Username` | The username of the user if you want it shown |
| `CurrentDeviceNames` | A HashSet of current device names to check against when assigning a name |

And last you can call start:
```cs
SoftAP.Start(softAPSettings);
```
---

When the soft AP process is complete, the static class `SoftAP.SoftAPResult` will be populated with the results

`Result`: The result of the process
`ParticleDevice`: The particle device that just went through the soft AP process

Possible result values:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Success` | The process completed successfully |
| `SuccessUnknown` | The process completed successfully, but you do not own the device |
| `SuccessDeviceOffline` | The process completed successfully, but is currently offline |
| `FailureConfigure` | The device was unable to be configured |

### Internally used direct soft AP commands

The Device Setup library currently also has the internally used class: [`SoftAPConfig`](https://github.com/particle-iot/particle-windows-devicesetup/blob/master/ParticleSetup/SoftAPConfig.cs) which is an object that enables all basic soft AP commands.

#### Get device ID

```cs
var deviceID = await SoftAPConfig.GetDeviceIdAsync();
```
---

#### Get public key

```cs
var publicKey = await SoftAPConfig.GetPublicKeyAsync();
```
---

#### Get scan AP's

```cs
var scanAPs = await SoftAPConfig.GetScanAPsAsync();
```
---

#### Get version

```cs
var version = await SoftAPConfig.GetVersionAsync();
```
---

#### Set claim code

* claimCode is the result from a call from `ParticleCloud.SharedCloud.CreateClaimCodeAsync()`

```cs
var result = await SoftAPConfig.SetClaimCodeAsync(claimCode);
```
---

#### Set configure AP

* index is the index you want to use for your call to `SetConnectAPAsync`
* scanAP is a scanAP from a call from `GetScanAPsAsync` 
* password is the plain text password for the above scanAP
* publicKey is the publicKey from a call from `GetPublicKeyAsync` 

```cs
var result = await SoftAPConfig.SetConfigureAPAsync(index, scanAP, password, publicKey);
```
---

#### Set connect AP

* index is the index you used in your call to `SetConfigureAPAsync`

```cs
var result = await SoftAPConfig.SetConnectAPAsync(index);
```
