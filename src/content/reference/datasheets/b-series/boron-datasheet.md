## Functional description

### Overview

The Boron is a powerful LTE Cat M1 or 2G/3G enabled development kit that supports cellular networks and Bluetooth LE (BLE). It is based on the Nordic nRF52840 and has built-in battery charging circuitry so it’s easy to connect a Li-Po and deploy your local network in minutes.

The Boron is great for connecting existing projects to the Particle Device Cloud where Wi-Fi is missing or unreliable.

The BRN404X model (LTE Cat M1, North America) can be found in the [Boron BRN404X datasheet](/reference/datasheets/b-series/brn404x-datasheet/).

### Device OS support

It is recommended that you use the latest version in the 4.x LTS release line with Boron models.

While the Boron 2G/3G (BRN314 and BRN310) and Boron LTE (BRN404 and BRN402) can use an older version of Device OS:
- Device OS 3.x is a developer preview release and has reached its end-of-support date.
- The 2.x LTS release line is in the Extended Support and Maintenance (ESM) window and will stop being supported in 2024.
- Earlier versions of Device OS have reached their end-of-support dates.

The BRN404X requires a minimum of Device OS 4.0.0, so if you have a mixed fleet of devices that contains both BRN404 and BRN404X devices, we recommend that you upgrade all devices in the fleet to use a consistent version of Device OS.

For information on upgrading Device OS, see [Version information](/reference/device-os/versions/). For the latest version shipped from the factory, see [Manufacturing firmware versions](/scaling/manufacturing/manufacturing-firmware-versions/) page. See also [Long Term Support (LTS) releases](/reference/product-lifecycle/long-term-support-lts-releases/).


## Interfaces

### Block diagram
 
{{imageOverlay src="/assets/images/boron/boron-block-diagram.png" large="/assets/images/boron/boron-block-diagram-large.png" alt="Block Diagram" class="full-width"}}

### Power

#### USB PORT
The USB port is the easiest way to power up the Boron. Please make sure that the USB port is able to provide at least 500mA. Power from the USB is regulated down to 3.3V by the on board Torex XC9258A step-down regulator. 

For powering the Boron 2G/3G version, you'll either need a USB port that is able support 2A current, or have the LiPo battery plugged in when powering over USB. This is because the on-board u-blox modem can consumes up to 1.8A peak current when operating in 2G mode. The Boron will intelligently source power from the USB most of the time and keep the battery charged. During peak current requirements, the additional power will be sourced from the battery. This reduces the charge-discharge cycle load on the battery, thus improving its longevity.

#### VUSB PIN
The pin is internally connected to the VBUS of the USB port. The nominal output should be around 4.5 to 5 VDC when the device is plugged into the USB port and 0 when not connected to a USB source. You can use this pin to power peripherals that operate at such voltages. Do not exceed the current rating of the USB port, which is nominally rated to 500mA.

#### LiPo
If you want to make your projects truly wireless, you can power the device with a single cell LiPo (3.7V). The Boron has an on board LiPo charger that will charge and power the device when USB source is plugged in, or power the device from the LiPo alone in the absence of the USB.

{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed warningBox"}}
**NOTE:**
Please pay attention to the polarity of the LiPo connector. Not all LiPo batteries follow the same polarity convention!
{{box op="end"}}

<div align=center><img src="/assets/images/lipo-polarity.png" ></div>

#### Li+ pin
This pin is internally connected to the positive terminal of the LiPo connector. You can connect a single cell LiPo/Lithium Ion or a DC supply source to this pin for powering the Boron. Remember that the input voltage range on this pin is 3.6 to 4.2 VDC. 

For the Boron 2G/3G version, make sure that the external DC supply is able to support 2A peak current requirements.

#### 3V3 PIN
This pin is the output of the on board 3.3V step-down switching regulator (Torex XC9258A). The regulator is rated at 1000mA max. When using this pin to power other devices or peripherals remember to budget in the current requirement of the Boron first. Unlike the Photon, this pin _CANNOT_ be used to power the Boron.

#### EN pin

The **EN** pin is not a power pin, per se, but it controls the 3V3 and cellular modem power via a load switch (XC8107, U2). The EN pin is pulled high by a 100K resistor to PMIC_SYS (3.8V), which is powered by VUSB, the micro USB connector, or the LiPo battery. Because the pull-up can result in voltages above 3.3V you should never directly connect EN to a 3.3V GPIO pin. Instead, you should only pull EN low, such as by using an N-channel MOSFET or other open-collector transistor.

The EN pin can force the device into a deep power-down state where it uses very little power. It also can used to assure that the device is completely reset, similar to unplugging it, with one caveat:

If using the EN pin to deeply reset the device, you must be careful not to allow leakage current back into the nRF52 MCU by GPIO or by pull-ups to 3V3. If you only power external devices by 3V3 you won't run into this, as 3V3 is de-powered when EN is low. 

However, if you have circuitry that is powered by a separate, external power supply, you must be careful. An externally powered circuit that drives a nRF52 GPIO high when EN is low can provide enough current to keep the nRF52 from powering down and resetting. Likewise, a pull-up to an external power supply can do the same thing. Be sure that in no circumstances can power by supplied to the nRF52 when 3V3 is de-powered.

[See the power supply schematic](#power-1), below, for more information.

### Antenna

There are two radios on the Boron. A BLE radio (nRF52840) and a cellular radio (u-blox). For the cellular radio, we have provided a u.FL connector to plug in the cellular antenna. This is required if you wish to use the cellular connectivity.

There are two options for the BLE antenna on the Boron. It comes with an on-board PCB antenna which is selected by default in the device OS and a u.FL connector if you wish to connect an external antenna. If you wish to use the external antenna, you'll need to issue an appropriate command in the firmware.

### FCC approved antennas

**BLE**

The following antenna is optional, as the Boron comes with an on-board chip antenna for BLE. It can be purchased in the [Particle online store](https://store.particle.io/products/wi-fi-or-mesh-2-4ghz-antenna).

### LED status

#### System RGB LED
For a detailed explanation of different color codes of the RGB system LED, please take a look [here.](/troubleshooting/led/)

#### Charge status LED

|State | Description |
|:---|:---|
|ON | Charging in progress |
|OFF | Charging complete |
|Blink at 1Hz| Fault condition<sup>[1]</sup> |
|Rapid blinking | Battery disconnected<sup>[2]</sup> |

**Notes:**

<sup>[1]</sup> A fault condition can occur due to several reasons, for example, battery over/under voltage, temperature fault or safety timer fault. You can find the root cause by reading the fault register of the power management IC in firmware.

<sup>[2]</sup> You can stop this behavior by either plugging in the LiPo battery or by disabling charging using firmware command: `PMIC().disableCharging();`.

The Boron uses two single row 0.1" pitch male header pins. One of them is 16 pin while the other is 12 pin. It can be mounted with matching 0.1" pitch female headers with a typical height of 0.335" (8.5mm). When you search for parts like these it can be difficult to navigate the thousands of parts available online so here are a few good choices for the Boron:

| Description | MFG | MFG Part Number |
|:----------- |:----|:----------------|
|16-pin 0.1" (2.54mm) Female Header|Sullins|PPTC161LFBN-RC|
|16-pin 0.1" (2.54mm) Female Header|TE|6-535541-4|
|12-pin 0.1" (2.54mm) Female Header|Sullins|PPTC121LFBN-RC|
|12-pin 0.1" (2.54mm) Female Header|TE|6-534237-0|


## Recommended PCB land pattern

The Boron can be directly soldered onto the PCB or be mounted with the above mentioned female headers.

## Assembly

### Water soluble flux

When attaching a Boron to your base board, we recommend using a socket. As there are components on the bottom side of the Boron there is no version available with castellated holes, solder pads, or similar techniques for direct surface mounting.

The pin headers on the bottom of the Boron are not intended to be reflowed using paste-in-hole. 

If you decide to wave solder or hand-solder the Boron directly to your base board, water soluble flux should not be used. There are components within the Boron module that are moisture-sensitive, and wash water can get trapped under the RF shields, causing damage.

Use no-clean flux instead if you must solder the Boron module.

### Conformal coatings

Boron modules should not use a conformal coating to protect the module from water. Some components on the module cannot be coated and would need to be masked off during coating. This will make the coating process difficult to implement and test.

Furthermore, the buttons cannot be protected by using a coating. Using an enclosure that protects both your base board and the Boron module as a single waterproof assembly is recommended instead.

## Product handling

### ESD precautions

The Boron contains highly sensitive electronic circuitry and is an Electrostatic Sensitive Device (ESD). Handling Boron without proper ESD protection may destroy or damage it permanently. Proper ESD handling and packaging procedures must be applied throughout the processing, handling and operation of any application that incorporates Boron. ESD precautions should be implemented on the application board where the Boron is mounted. Failure to observe these precautions can result in severe damage to the Boron!

### Connectors

There are four connectors on the Boron that will get damaged with improper usage. The JST connector on the circuit board, where you plug in the LiPo battery, is very durable but the connector on the battery itself is not. When unplugging the battery, take extra precaution to **NOT** pull the connector using the wires, but instead hold the plug at its base to avoid putting stress on the wires. This can be tricky with bare hands - nose pliers are your friend here.

<div align=center><img src="/assets/images/lipo-connection.png" ></div>

The micro B USB connector on the Boron is soldered on the PCB with large surface pads as well as couple of through hole anchor points. Despite this reinforcement, it is very easy to rip out the connector if too much stress is put on in the vertical direction.

<div align=center><img src="/assets/images/proper-usb-connection.png" ></div>

The U.FL antenna connector is not designed to be constantly plugged and unplugged. The antenna pin is static sensitive and you can destroy the radio with improper handling. A tiny dab of glue (epoxy, rubber cement, liquid tape or hot glue) on the connector can be used securely hold the plug in place.

The 10 pin SWD connector provides an easy in-system debugging access to the device. The pins on the connector can easily be damaged if the mating connector cable is inserted improperly. If you are trying to debug the device, you probably are not in a good mood to begin with. The last thing you want is to render the connector useless. Be nice, and be gentle on the connector. Good luck with the debugging!

### Breadboarding

The breadboard provided with the Boron is specifically designed to require low insertion force. This makes it easy to plug the Boron in and out of the breadboard. If you end up using a different breadboard, remember that it may require more force. In this case, always remember to pinch-hold your precious Boron by the sides (along the header pins) when plugging-unplugging and not by the USB connector (don't be this person).

## Default settings

The Boron comes preprogrammed with a bootloader and a user application called Tinker. This application works with an iOS and Android app also named Tinker that allows you to very easily toggle digital pins, take analog and digital readings and drive variable PWM outputs.

The bootloader allows you to easily update the user application via several different methods, USB, OTA, Serial Y-Modem, and also internally via the Factory Reset procedure. All of these methods have multiple tools associated with them as well.
