## In the box

### Cables

There are two cables in the box. The M12 8-pin in connector is used for power, and includes a barrel connector adapter.

![M12 8-pin](/assets/images/monitor-one/m12-8.jpeg)

There is also an M12 4-pin connector for expansion. The I/O card uses this connector for the relay and the 0-10V opto-isolated digital input.

![M12 4-pin](/assets/images/monitor-one/m12-4.jpeg)

### Power supply

The small rectangular box contains a power supply. 

The DC output is 24 V DC at 1A (24W). The connector is a 5.5x2.1mm barrel plug, center positive.

### Connectors

![Bottom Connectors](/assets/images/monitor-one/bottom-connectors-labeled.png)


The bottom plate of the Monitor One can be customized with different connectors for your application.

| Label | Feature |
| :---: | :--- |
|  1 | Cellular antenna (SMA) |
|  2 | M12 connector (8-pin) |
|  3 | M12 connector (4-pin) |
|  4 | GNSS antenna (SMA) |
|  5 | Mounting plate attachment screw |

The Monitor One only uses the internal cellular and GNSS antennas. The cellular (1) and GNSS (4) antenna connectors are not connected internally and are not certified for use.


### I/O expansion M12 8-pin to flying leads

The Monitor One includes a M12 8-pin male to flying leads cable, 1500&plusmn;20mm (about 60 inches or 5 feet). This is used to power the Monitor One, and also use the 4-20mA, 0-10V analog in, CAN bus, and RS485 (Modbus) interfaces.

### I/O expansion M12 4-pin to flying leads

The Monitor One includes a M12 4-pin male to flying leads cable, 1500&plusmn;20mm (about 60 inches or 5 feet). You do not need to connect this cable initially.

## Powering the Monitor One

The Monitor One Developer Edition includes a 24V 1A (24W) power adapter (1). Your power adapter may be slightly different.

Locate the M12 8-pin cable (2). There are two cables, a 4-pin and an 8-pin, and the 8-pin is used for power.

The cable includes a barrel connector adapter (3). Connect the 5.5x2.1mm barrel jack on the power adapter to the barrel connector adapter.

Connect the M12 8-pin connector to the Monitor One (4). The 8-pin connector is on the left with the label facing up, closest to the cellular SMA connector. Some threads may be exposed even when the connector is fully seated; this is normal and does not affect the IP67 waterproof rating.

## Setting up the device

To set up the device and associate it with your Particle account, visit [setup.particle.io](https://setup.particle.io/). The Monitor One is setup as as Tracker device, as both contain the Tracker SoM module.

At setup.particle.io, you will be given a choice between setting up a device by USB or setting up a Monitor One.

![Select Monitor One](/assets/images/monitor-one/setup-select-monitor-one.png)

You will then be asked for the serial number. It is available under the mounting plate as pictured.

![Enter serial number](/assets/images/monitor-one/setup-enter-serial.png)

It is also available on the bottom of the box. The serial number begins with "P" and a 3-digit number. It's currently P031 or P032 but this could change.

![Serial number sticker](/assets/images/monitor-one/box-serial-number.png)

Just follow the instructions in the setup application to complete setup.
