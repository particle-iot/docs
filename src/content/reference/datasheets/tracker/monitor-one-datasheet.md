*The pictures in this preliminary datasheet are of a pre-release unit. The production units will be a different color, and may have other minor differences.*

The Monitor One is an off-the-shelf complete design, like the Tracker One. The Monitor One is in a larger IP67 waterproof enclosure with room inside for expansion cards and additional connectors, allowing it to be used in more custom scenarios than the Tracker One.

- **Ready to go** with rugged IP67-rated enclosure with room inside for expansion cards and additional connectors.
- **Flexible power supply** to easily add asset tracking to most devices with a 6 - 90 VDC power input and a large 18650 LiPo battery pack.
- **Internal or external antennas** for cellular and GNSS.
- **Temperature sensors** within the enclosure, and also a battery pack temperature sensor.
- **Expansion cards** allow for custom features.
- **RGB LEDs** for system status, and two user RGB LEDs for your own use, visible from outside the enclosure.
- **User button**, waterproof and accessible from outside the enclosure.

## External features

{{imageOverlay src="/assets/images/monitor-one/post-corner-labeled.png" alt="External features" class="full-width"}}


| Label | Feature |
| :---: | :--- |
|  1 | System RGB LED |
|  2 | GNSS antenna (internal) |
|  3 | Cellular antenna (internal) |
|  4 | External connectors (on bottom) |
|  5 | Magnetic, bolt-down, or strap down mounting bracket |
|  6 | User RGB LEDs (2) |
|  7 | User button (externally accessible) |
|  8 | Wi-Fi geolocation antenna (internal) |

### User button

A waterproof button is available from the outside of the enclosure.

- Long press (10 seconds) resets the device (as if the RESET button was pressed)
- Shorter press and multiple press can be handled by your user firmware for your own features

### User LEDs (2)

- There are two small RGB LEDs visible from the outside on the side of the unit, next to the user button.
- You can program custom colors, blinking, and fade effects for each LED from your user firmware.
- LEDs are controlled by a ADP8866 I2C LED controller.


### Connectors

{{imageOverlay src="/assets/images/monitor-one/bottom-connectors-labeled.png" alt="Bottom Connectors" class="full-width"}}


The bottom plate of the Monitor One can be customized with different connectors for your application.

| Label | Feature |
| :---: | :--- |
|  1 | Cellular antenna (SMA) |
|  2 | M12 connector (8-pin) |
|  3 | M12 connector (4-pin) |
|  4 | GNSS antenna (SMA) |
|  5 | Mounting plate attachment screw |

By default the Monitor One uses the internal cellular and GNSS antennas, but can be switched to using the external connectors inside the enclosure.


## Mounting

The Monitor One is intended to be mounted in the orientation shown at the top of the page, with the connectors facing down. You can also mount it with the mounting plate facing down as the GNSS antenna is angled to allow it to work in either orientation.

When using external cellular and GNSS antennas you can orient the Monitor One in any direction.

The mounting plate contains two magnets that allow it to be easily mounted on a metal surface, or to a metal plate affixed to a non-metal surface, such as the wood post shown above.

{{imageOverlay src="/assets/images/monitor-one/back-view.jpg" alt="Back View" class="full-width"}}

The mounting plate is removable from the back of the unit after removing the screw on the bottom, near the expansion connectors.

Once removed, you can screw or bolt the mounting plate to a surface and reattach the Monitor One. This is good for rough conditions and to help prevent theft.

## Expansion card interface

Tracker M is designed with easy-to-use expansion headers and an enclosure with sufficient space inside for an expansion card, and for additional expansion connector through the wall of enclosure.

- Expansion card size: 50mm x 90mm (approximately 2" x 3.5")
- Connectors: 24-pin 0.1" headers (two, one on each long side)
- Male header pins on the bottom of expansion card
- Attachment: 4 screws to standoffs (M3 screw recommended)

Pre-built expansion cards will be available, including a prototyping breadboard expansion card. You can also design and fabricate your own.

The CAN transceiver is included on the Tracker SoM. However if you implement CAN on your expansion card, you will probably want to add protection circuitry. This circuit is present on the Monitor One CAN expansion card and also on the Tracker One.

{{imageOverlay src="/assets/images/monitor-one/can-schematic.png" alt="CAN schematic" class="full-width"}}

Note that the two 60.4 ohm resistors are DNP (do not populate). If populated, these provide the 120 ohm CAN termination, if you need it in your design.

### I/O Characteristics

The GPIO pins on the expansion connector have the following specifications, from the nRF52840 datasheet:

| Symbol | Parameter | Min | Typ | Max | Unit |
| :---------|:-------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---: |
| VIH | Input high voltage | 0.7 xVDD |  | VDD | V |
| VIL | Input low voltage | VSS |  | 0.3 xVDD | V | 
| VOH,SD | Output high voltage, standard drive, 0.5 mA, VDD ≥1.7 | VDD - 0.4 |  | VDD | V | 
| VOH,HDH | Output high voltage, high drive, 5 mA, VDD >= 2.7 V | VDD - 0.4 |  | VDD | V | 
| VOH,HDL | Output high voltage, high drive, 3 mA, VDD >= 1.7 V  | VDD - 0.4 |  | VDD | V | 
| VOL,SD | Output low voltage, standard drive, 0.5 mA, VDD ≥1.7 | VSS |  | VSS + 0.4 | V | 
| VOL,HDH | Output low voltage, high drive, 5 mA, VDD >= 2.7 V | VSS |  | VSS + 0.4 | V | 
| VOL,HDL | Output low voltage, high drive,3 mA, VDD >= 1.7 V | VSS  |  | VSS + 0.4 | V |  
| IOL,SD | Current at VSS+0.4 V, output set low, standard drive, VDD≥1.7 | 1 | 2 | 4 | mA | 
| IOL,HDH | Current at VSS+0.4 V, output set low, high drive, VDD >= 2.7V | 6 | 10 | 15 | mA | 
| IOL,HDL | Current at VSS+0.4 V, output set low, high drive, VDD >= 1.7V | 3 |  |  | mA | 
| IOH,SD | Current at VDD-0.4 V, output set high, standard drive, VDD≥1.7 | 1 | 2 | 4 | mA | 
| IOH,HDH | Current at VDD-0.4 V, output set high, high drive, VDD >= 2.7V | 6 | 9 | 14 | mA | 
| IOH,HDL | Current at VDD-0.4 V, output set high, high drive, VDD >= 1.7V | 3 |  |  | mA | 
| RPU | Pull-up resistance | 11 | 13 | 16 | kΩ | 
| RPD | Pull-down resistance | 11 | 13 | 16 | kΩ | 

- GPIO default to standard drive (2mA) but can be reconfigured to high drive (9mA) in Device OS 2.0.0 and later using the [`pinSetDriveStrength()`](/reference/device-os/api/input-output/pinsetdrivestrength/) function.

### GPIO and port leakage current warning

Be careful when you are connecting GPIO or ports such as serial that may have power when the Monitor One is not powered, such as when using shipping mode.

If you have current flowing into GPIO or ports of the nRF52840 when it is powered down, it can cause it to enter a state where it cannot be reawaked without removing all power from it, including the internal LiPo battery. This may be difficult if you've sealed your Monitor One enclosure.

The Tracker One has a [TI TS3A5018 Quad SPDT Analog Switch](/assets/datasheets/ts3a5018.pdf) on the three GPIO pins (A3, D9/RX/SDA, D8/TX/SCL) to prevent this. The switch is normally open, and is closed when the `CAN_5V` is powered. By default, Tracker Edge enables `CAN_5V` when in normal operating mode and turns it off during sleep, however this behavior can be changed by using `enableIoCanPower()` and `enableIoCanPowerSleep()` in the `TrackerConfiguration` object.

The Tracker One circuit looks like this, and you may want to implement something similar if you are in a scenario where you have externally powered peripherals.

{{imageOverlay src="/assets/images/tracker/tracker-io-schematic.png" alt="CAN Protection Circuitry" class="full-width"}}


This is not necessary if your external peripherals are powered by 3V3 or CAN_5V.

### VIN disable

By default, if power is applied at the VIN pin it will be used to power the Monitor One and charge the built-in battery.

If you are supplying VIN from another, larger battery pack, and want to be able to disconnect the VIN power supply to minimize current loss, you can do so using the following circuit:

{{imageOverlay src="/assets/images/monitor-one/vin-disable.png" alt="VIN disable" class="full-width"}}

By disconnecting the VIN power supply, it reduces the current used by the VIN and PMIC voltage regulators. The Monitor One can still be powered by its internal LiPo battery. This is particularly advantageous if the Monitor One is in sleep mode while VIN is disconnected as the power supply loss will be large compared to the very low sleep current in this scenario.

<sup>1</sup>On the Tracker One, the M8 can be configured for GPIO, I2C (SDA and SCL), or Serial (RX and TX) on two pins.

<sup>2</sup>Both internal and external GNSS and cellular are supported by physically changing the antenna connector inside the enclosure.

<sup>3</sup>There is no external MCU USB connector on the Monitor One.

<sup>4</sup>The Monitor One uses the Tracker SoM BLE chip antenna on the board and does not include a separate BLE antenna, but one could be added using the BLE U.FL connector.

<sup>5</sup>The Tracker M uses a shared antenna for BLE and Wi-Fi geolocation. You can use the built-in trace antenna or an external 2.4 GHz/5 GHz dual-band antenna, selectable in software.

<sup>6</sup>A small portion of the flash file system is used by the system, and a configurable portion can be used for store and forward, to optionally allow location publishes to be saved when the device is offline to be uploaded later. The remainder of the flash file system can be used by user applications.
