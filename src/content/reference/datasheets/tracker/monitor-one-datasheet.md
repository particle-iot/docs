The Monitor One is an off-the-shelf complete gateway design, like the Tracker One. The Monitor One is in a larger IP67 waterproof enclosure with room inside for an expansion card and additional connectors, allowing it to be used in more custom scenarios than the Tracker One.

- **Ready to go** with rugged IP67-rated enclosure with room inside for an expansion card.
- **Flexible power supply** to easily add asset tracking to most devices with a 6 - 30 VDC power input and a large 18650 LiPo battery pack.
- **Internal or external antennas** for cellular and GNSS.
- **Temperature sensors** on the carrier board, and also a battery pack temperature sensor.
- **Expansion card connector** to allow for custom application specific hardware.
- **RGB LED** for system status, and two user RGB LEDs for your own use, visible from outside the enclosure.
- **User button**, waterproof and accessible from outside the enclosure.

Particle gateway device like the Monitor One and Tracker One are designed to be used off-the-shelf to interface to other devices and sensors using standard protocols such as CAN bus, I2C, and serial.

For information on setting up a Monitor One Developer Edition, see the [Monitor One Quickstart](/quickstart/monitor-one/).

*The pictures in this datasheet are of a pre-release unit.*

## External features

{{imageOverlay src="/assets/images/monitor-one/post-corner-labeled.png" alt="External features" class="full-width"}}


| Label | Feature |
| :---: | :--- |
|  1 | System RGB LED |
|  2 | GNSS antenna (internal) |
|  3 | Cellular antenna (internal) |
|  4 | External connectors (on bottom) |
|  5 | Magnetic, bolt-down, or strap-down mounting bracket |
|  6 | User RGB LEDs (2) |
|  7 | User button (externally accessible) |
|  8 | Wi-Fi geolocation antenna (internal, optional) |
|  9 | Cover screws (6) (M2 hex, 2mm) |

### User button

A waterproof button is available from the outside of the enclosure.

- Long press (10 seconds) resets the device (as if the RESET button was pressed)
- Shorter press and multiple press can be handled by your user firmware for your own features

### User LEDs (2)

- There are two small RGB LEDs visible from the outside on the side of the unit, next to the user button.
- The upper LED defaults to being a GNSS lock indicator:
  - Off: GNSS off
  - Blinking (green): attempting to get a GNSS fix
  - On (green): GNSS fix acquired
- You can program custom colors, blinking, and fade effects from your user firmware for the lower LED.
- LEDs are controlled by a ADP8866 I2C LED controller.

### Connectors

{{imageOverlay src="/assets/images/monitor-one/bottom-connectors-labeled.png" alt="Bottom Connectors" class="full-width"}}


The bottom plate of the Monitor One can be customized with different connectors for your application.

| Label | Feature |
| :---: | :--- |
|  1 | Cellular antenna (SMA) |
|  2 | M12 connector (8-pin) |
|  3 | M12 connector (4-pin) |
|  4 | GNSS antenna (SMA) |
|  5 | Mounting plate attachment screw |

By default the Monitor One uses the internal cellular and GNSS antennas, but can be switched to using the external connectors inside the enclosure.

The cellular (1) and GNSS (4) antennas are not connected internally at the factory. In order to use the external connectors you must open the case, disconnect the internal antenna, and instead connect the U.FL connector for the external jack.

The Monitor One is equipped with 2 external-facing SMA bulkhead connectors for both cellular and GNSS but are disconnected internally. The hardware is ready for use with external antennas giving the ability to connect a wide variety of application-specific antennas. It is recommended that the user perform required RF certifications with the selected antenna installed as the Monitor One has only been certified for use in select regions with the internal antennas.


## Mounting

The Monitor One is intended to be mounted in the orientation shown at the top of the page, with the connectors facing down. You can also mount it with the mounting plate mounted on a flat surface as the GNSS antenna is angled to allow it to work in either orientation.

When using external cellular and GNSS antennas you can orient the Monitor One in other directions.

| 1 | Mounting screw or bolt holes|
| 2 | Slots for strap mounting |
| 3 | Magnets |
| 4 | Mounting plate removal screw (M3 hex, 3mm) |

The mounting plate contains two magnets (3) that allow it to be easily mounted on a metal surface.

The mounting plate is removable from the back of the unit after removing the screw on the bottom (4), near the expansion connectors.

Once removed, you can screw or bolt the mounting plate through the four holes (1) and reattach the Monitor One. This is good for rough conditions and for mounting on non-metal surfaces.

The mounting plate can be strap mounted through the two slots (2).

The magnets do not need to removed to use screw, bolt, or strap mounting.

| 8 | Black | Ground | |


{{imageOverlay src="/assets/images/monitor-one/m12-8-flying.png" alt="M12 8-pin flying leads" class="full-width"}}

Also included is an adapter from screw terminals to a 5.5x2.1mm barrel jack, center positive. If you disconnect and reconnect the adapter, make sure the + screw terminal is connected to red and the - screw terminal is connected to black. An appropriate 24 VDC power adapter is included.

Any 6VDC to 30VDC power adapter at 2A with a 5.5x2.1mm barrel connector, center positive can be used instead, if desired. For automotive use, you can use this power input directly to a 12V or 24V vehicle power system as the power supply is designed to handle transient voltage present on vehicle power systems.

The RS485 and CAN interface pins on the M12 8-pin connector cannot be used as GPIO.

### I/O Card M12 4-pin to flying leads

The Monitor One includes a M12 4-pin male to flying leads cable, 1500&plusmn;20mm (about 60 inches or 5 feet).

The M12 4-pin bulkhead connector has flying leads that are connected to the screw terminals (18) as follows:

| M12 Pin | Color | Card |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| 1 | Red | INPUT |
| 2 | Green | COM |
| 3 | Black | GND |
| 4 | Blue | NO |


### Customizing the I/O Card

If you wish to build upon the I/O Card, there is a small prototyping area (1). 

If you need signals from the expansion card interface, they are available in the rows of pins (19, 20).

If you wish to disable an interface that you are not using and re-use the pins on the M12 8-pin connector, there is a small trace jumper between the rows of pins in area (14). Cutting this trace isolates the expansion card signal from the signal to the connector (16). Then you can solder a small jumper wire to replace the signal on the M12 8-pin.

The Eagle CAD schematic and board layout files for the I/O card can be found in the [Monitor One Github repository](https://github.com/particle-iot/monitor-one).

| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| A | Red | 1 |
| B | Black | 3 |
| C | Green | 2 |
| D | Blue | 4 |

- The order of these pins isn't significant, but this is how the I/O Card is wired, so it probably best to be consistent.

The Eagle CAD schematic and board layout files for the prototype can be found in the [Monitor One Github repository](https://github.com/particle-iot/monitor-one).


## Expansion card interface

- Expansion card size: 50mm x 90mm (approximately 2" x 3.5")
- Connectors: 24-pin 0.1" headers (two, one on each long side)
- Male header pins on the bottom of expansion card
- Attachment: 4 screws to standoffs (M3 screw recommended)

Pre-built expansion cards will be available, including the Prototype Card. You can also design and fabricate your own.

If you are building your own card, you can start with the design for the I/O card or prototype card. The Eagle CAD schematic and board layout files can be found in [Monitor One Github repository](https://github.com/particle-iot/monitor-one).

The CAN transceiver is included on the Tracker SoM. However if you implement CAN on your expansion card, you will probably want to add protection circuitry. This circuit is present on the Monitor One CAN expansion card and also on the Tracker One.

{{imageOverlay src="/assets/images/monitor-one/can-schematic.png" alt="CAN schematic" class="full-width"}}

Note that the two 60.4 ohm resistors are DNP (do not populate). If populated, these provide the 120 ohm CAN termination, if you need it in your design.

- Pins 9 and 10 have NFC in the name from the Tracker SoM, however NFC cannot be used on the Monitor One as the pins must be used as `VIN_EN` and `PERIPH_INT`.

### I/O characteristics

The GPIO pins on the expansion connector have the following specifications, from the nRF52840 datasheet:

| Symbol | Parameter | Min | Typ | Max | Unit |
| :---------|:-------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---: |
| VIH | Input high voltage | 0.7 xVDD |  | VDD | V |
| VIL | Input low voltage | VSS |  | 0.3 xVDD | V | 
| VOH,SD | Output high voltage, standard drive, 0.5 mA, VDD ≥1.7 | VDD - 0.4 |  | VDD | V | 
| VOH,HDH | Output high voltage, high drive, 5 mA, VDD >= 2.7 V | VDD - 0.4 |  | VDD | V | 
| VOH,HDL | Output high voltage, high drive, 3 mA, VDD >= 1.7 V  | VDD - 0.4 |  | VDD | V | 
| VOL,SD | Output low voltage, standard drive, 0.5 mA, VDD ≥1.7 | VSS |  | VSS + 0.4 | V | 
| VOL,HDH | Output low voltage, high drive, 5 mA, VDD >= 2.7 V | VSS |  | VSS + 0.4 | V | 
| VOL,HDL | Output low voltage, high drive,3 mA, VDD >= 1.7 V | VSS  |  | VSS + 0.4 | V |  
| IOL,SD | Current at VSS+0.4 V, output set low, standard drive, VDD≥1.7 | 1 | 2 | 4 | mA | 
| IOL,HDH | Current at VSS+0.4 V, output set low, high drive, VDD >= 2.7V | 6 | 10 | 15 | mA | 
| IOL,HDL | Current at VSS+0.4 V, output set low, high drive, VDD >= 1.7V | 3 |  |  | mA | 
| IOH,SD | Current at VDD-0.4 V, output set high, standard drive, VDD≥1.7 | 1 | 2 | 4 | mA | 
| IOH,HDH | Current at VDD-0.4 V, output set high, high drive, VDD >= 2.7V | 6 | 9 | 14 | mA | 
| IOH,HDL | Current at VDD-0.4 V, output set high, high drive, VDD >= 1.7V | 3 |  |  | mA | 
| RPU | Pull-up resistance | 11 | 13 | 16 | kΩ | 
| RPD | Pull-down resistance | 11 | 13 | 16 | kΩ | 

- GPIO default to standard drive (2mA) but can be reconfigured to high drive (9mA) in Device OS 2.0.0 and later using the [`pinSetDriveStrength()`](/reference/device-os/api/input-output/pinsetdrivestrength/) function.

### GPIO and port leakage current warning

Be careful when you are connecting GPIO or ports such as serial that may have power when the Monitor One is not powered, such as when using shipping mode.

If you have current flowing into GPIO or ports of the nRF52840 when it is powered down, it can cause it to enter a state where it cannot be reawaked without removing all power from it, including the internal LiPo battery. This may be difficult if you've sealed your Monitor One enclosure.

The Tracker One has a [TI TS3A5018 Quad SPDT Analog Switch](/assets/datasheets/ts3a5018.pdf) on the three GPIO pins (A3, D9/RX/SDA, D8/TX/SCL) to prevent this. The switch is normally open, and is closed when the `CAN_5V` is powered. By default, Tracker Edge enables `CAN_5V` when in normal operating mode and turns it off during sleep, however this behavior can be changed by using `enableIoCanPower()` and `enableIoCanPowerSleep()` in the `TrackerConfiguration` object.

The Tracker One circuit looks like this, and you may want to implement something similar if you are in a scenario where you have externally powered peripherals.

{{imageOverlay src="/assets/images/tracker/tracker-io-schematic.png" alt="CAN Protection Circuitry" class="full-width"}}


This is not necessary if your external peripherals are powered by 3V3 or CAN_5V.

### VIN disable

By default, if power is applied at the VIN pin it will be used to power the Monitor One and charge the built-in battery.

If you are supplying VIN from another, larger battery pack, and want to be able to disconnect the VIN power supply to minimize current loss, you can do so using the following circuit in lieu of using NFC2 as the relay pin, as the I/O Card does.

{{imageOverlay src="/assets/images/monitor-one/vin-disable.png" alt="VIN disable" class="full-width"}}

By disconnecting the VIN power supply, it reduces the current used by the VIN and PMIC voltage regulators. The Monitor One can still be powered by its internal LiPo battery. This is particularly advantageous if the Monitor One is in sleep mode while VIN is disconnected as the power supply loss will be large compared to the very low sleep current in this scenario.

<sup>1</sup>On the Tracker One, the M8 can be configured for GPIO, I2C (SDA and SCL), or Serial (RX and TX) on two pins.

<sup>2</sup>Both internal and external GNSS and cellular are supported by physically changing the antenna connector inside the enclosure.

<sup>3</sup>There is no external MCU USB connector on the Monitor One.

<sup>4</sup>The Monitor One uses the Tracker SoM BLE chip antenna on the board and does not include a separate BLE antenna, but one could be added using the BLE U.FL connector.

<sup>5</sup>The Tracker M uses a shared antenna for BLE and Wi-Fi geolocation. You can use the built-in trace antenna or an external 2.4 GHz/5 GHz dual-band antenna, selectable in software.

<sup>6</sup>A small portion of the flash file system is used by the system, and a configurable portion can be used for store and forward, to optionally allow location publishes to be saved when the device is offline to be uploaded later. The remainder of the flash file system can be used by user applications.
