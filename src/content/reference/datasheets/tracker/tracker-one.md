### Power and I/O connector (M8)

| M8 Pin | Function   | Function  | Function  | I/O | Color |
| :----: | :-------   | :-------  | :-------  | :--- | :--- |
| 1      | CAN_P / CANH |           |           | IO<sup>2</sup> | Yellow |

The IP67 M8, 8-pin, male pins with threaded barrel connector is accessible from the outside of the enclosure. 

![M8 connector](/assets/images/at-som/M8-connector.png)

View as looking into the M8 connector on the outside of the enclosure.

Note: Version 003 and earlier of this datasheet had a different pin numbering for M8 connector that didn't match the connector manufacturer's numbering. Only the numbering has changed; the function of the pin at a given location is unchanged and the change should not affect existing designs.

<sup>1</sup>MCU GPIO is limited to 3.3V maximum.

<sup>2</sup>CAN Bus specifications can be found in the [Tracker SoM datasheet](/reference/datasheets/tracker/tracker-som-datasheet/#can-specifications). 

<sup>3</sup>6.0 to 30 VDC at 2A when using the M8 connector. 6.0 - 90 VDC at 2A when connecting directly to the board.

<sup>4</sup>5V, 370 mA maximum. Controlled by the CAN_PWR GPIO.

Additional information on M8 cables and connectors can be found in the [M8 Accessories Datasheet](/reference/datasheets/tracker/tracker-m8-accessories/).

You must enable CAN_5V in order to use GPIO on M8 pins 3, 4, and 5 (A3, D9/RX/SDA, D8/TX/SCL) on the Tracker One. If CAN_5V is not powered, these pins are isolated from the MCU starting with version 1.1 of the Tracker One/Tracker Carrier Board (September 2020 and later). This is necessary to prevent an issue with shipping mode, see technical advisory note [TAN002](/reference/technical-advisory-notices/tan002-tracker-one-v10-shipping-mode/).

Note that CAN bus is differential and consists of two lines:

- CAN_P (positive), CANH (high), or CAN+
- CAN_N (negative), CANL (low), or CAN-

As the signals are differential you don't need to connect GND for CAN bus, but you do still need to connect it for Serial, I2C, or GPIO.


### I/O characteristics (M8)

The three GPIO and port pins (A3/D3, RX/SDA/D9, TX/SCL/D8) have the following characteristics:

| Symbol | Parameter | Min | Typ | Max | Unit |
| :---------|:-------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---: |
| VIH | Input high voltage | 0.7 xVDD |  | VDD | V |
| VIL | Input low voltage | VSS |  | 0.3 xVDD | V | 
| VOH,SD | Output high voltage, standard drive, 0.5 mA, VDD ≥1.7 | VDD - 0.4 |  | VDD | V | 
| VOH,HDH | Output high voltage, high drive, 5 mA, VDD >= 2.7 V | VDD - 0.4 |  | VDD | V | 
| VOH,HDL | Output high voltage, high drive, 3 mA, VDD >= 1.7 V  | VDD - 0.4 |  | VDD | V | 
| VOL,SD | Output low voltage, standard drive, 0.5 mA, VDD ≥1.7 | VSS |  | VSS + 0.4 | V | 
| VOL,HDH | Output low voltage, high drive, 5 mA, VDD >= 2.7 V | VSS |  | VSS + 0.4 | V | 
| VOL,HDL | Output low voltage, high drive,3 mA, VDD >= 1.7 V | VSS  |  | VSS + 0.4 | V |  
| IOL,SD | Current at VSS+0.4 V, output set low, standard drive, VDD≥1.7 | 1 | 2 | 4 | mA | 
| IOL,HDH | Current at VSS+0.4 V, output set low, high drive, VDD >= 2.7V | 6 | 10 | 15 | mA | 
| IOL,HDL | Current at VSS+0.4 V, output set low, high drive, VDD >= 1.7V | 3 |  |  | mA | 
| IOH,SD | Current at VDD-0.4 V, output set high, standard drive, VDD≥1.7 | 1 | 2 | 4 | mA | 
| IOH,HDH | Current at VDD-0.4 V, output set high, high drive, VDD >= 2.7V | 6 | 9 | 14 | mA | 
| IOH,HDL | Current at VDD-0.4 V, output set high, high drive, VDD >= 1.7V | 3 |  |  | mA | 
| RPU | Pull-up resistance | 11 | 13 | 16 | kΩ | 
| RPD | Pull-down resistance | 11 | 13 | 16 | kΩ | 

- GPIO default to standard drive (2mA) but can be reconfigured to high drive (9mA) in Device OS 2.0.0 and later using the [`pinSetDriveStrength()`](/reference/device-os/api/input-output/pinsetdrivestrength/) function.

The Tracker One has a [TI TS3A5018 Quad SPDT Analog Switch](/assets/datasheets/ts3a5018.pdf) on the three GPIO pins (A3, D9/RX/SDA, D8/TX/SCL). The switch is normally open, and is closed when the `CAN_5V` is powered. By default, Tracker Edge enables `CAN_5V` when in normal operating mode and turns it off during sleep, however this behavior can be changed by using `enableIoCanPower()` and `enableIoCanPowerSleep()` in the `TrackerConfiguration` object.

The circuit looks like this:

![](/assets/images/tracker/tracker-io-schematic.png)

Because this is an analog switch, the nRF52840 current limitations, 2 mA in standard drive (the default), and 9 mA in high drive also apply on the M8 side of the analog switch. The switch is rated up to 300 MHz, higher than the highest UART or I2C baud rate. The 3.3V recommended maximum for GPIO also applies on the M8 connector.

The CAN bus has a separate hardware transceiver and is not considered to be GPIO and does not have a 3.3V limitation.

### Carrier board power and I/O connector

The connector on the carrier board itself is is a [JST B8B-PH-SM4-TB(LF)(SN)](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/jst-sales-america-inc/B8B-PH-SM4-TB-LF-SN/455-1740-1-ND/926837), 8-position, 2mm pitch, male pins, shrouded. The mating connector is the [JST PHR-8](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/jst-sales-america-inc/PHR-8/455-1189-ND/608630). The female sockets are available plain, with leads, and in pre-manufactured ribbon cable formats.

| PHR-8 Pin | M8 Pin | Function  | Color          | 
| :-------: | :----: | :-------- | :------------- | 
| 1         | 2      | VIN       | Red            | 
| 2         | 1      | CAN_P     | Yellow         |  
| 3         | 7      | CAN_N     | Blue           |  
| 4         | 6      | CAN_5V    | Orange         |  
| 5         | 5      | TX_SCL_D8 | Brown          |  
| 6         | 4      | RX_SDA_D9 | Green          |  
| 7         | 3      | A3        | White          |  
| 8         | 8      | GND       | Black          |  


### Additional peripherals

| Signal | Device OS | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---
| THERM | A0 | NTC Thermistor |
| USER | A1 | USER button | 
| GNSS_LOCK | A2 | GNSS lock indicator |
| GPIO1 | A3 | GPIO on power and I/O connector |
| MCU TX | TX | MCU serial TX, GPIO D8, Wire3 SCL | 
| MCU RX | RX | MCU serial RX, GPIO D9, Wire3 SDA | 

Note: While the USER button exists inside the Tracker One, the Tracker One is a sealed unit and opening it will void the warranty and may affect certifications, thus it is not practical to use. It can be used with the Tracker Carrier Board.

### Powering the Tracker carrier board

There are several options for powering the carrier board:

The **MCU USB** connector (USB-C). If using a laptop with a USB-A to USB-C cable and a 500 mA USB port, you should also use the LiPo battery. With an true USB-C port and cable, or a 2A tablet charger, you can power only by USB.

The **VIN** connector (6 to 30 VDC at 2A on the M8 connector, or 6 to 90 VDC at 2A to the B8B-PH connector on the board). This is useful with an external power supply.

The **LiPo** connector. This is typically used with a LiPo battery.

### USB connector

There is a single USB C connector on the carrier board. On the Tracker One, this exits the enclosure and is IP67 rated.

A set of DIP switches on the carrier board allow this port to be connected to either the MCU (normal) or u-blox GNSS (for firmware updates). The normal state is 1-4 OFF and 5-6 ON to connect the USB to the nRF52840. To connect the USB-C to the u-blox GNSS, turn 1-4 ON and 5-6 OFF. Disconnect the USB-C and the LiPo battery before changing the switch settings.

### LED Indicators

The **RGB LED** default behavior is:

- Red breathing: Attempting to connect to the cellular network
- Yellow breathing: Connecting to the cloud, weaker cellular signal
- Green breathing: Connecting to the cloud, good cellular signal
- Yellow solid: Connected to the cloud, weaker cellular signal
- Green solid: Connected to the cloud, good cellular signal

Alternatively the LED can be configured to the typical Particle color scheme (blinking green, blinking cyan, breathing cyan) via device or cloud configuration. Custom device firmware can provide other color schemes if desired.


The **CHRG** LED indicates the charge status:

- Off: Not charging or no power
- On: Charging
- Blinking: Charge fault
- Flickering: No battery

The **GNSS** LED indicates the GNSS fix status:

- Off: GNSS is powered off.
- Blinking (1 Hz): Attempting to get a GNSS fix
- On: Has a GNSS fix.

## Antennas

| Antenna | Location |
| :------ | :------- |
| GNSS | Carrier Board (faces top of case) |
| Wi-Fi | Left Side |
| BLE | Left Side |
| NFC | Top |
| Cellular | Right Side |

![Tracker One Antennas](/assets/images/at-som/tracker-one-antennas.png)

As the GNSS antenna faces the top of the case, you also want the top of the case facing the sky to the greatest extent possible. You will likely be be unable to get a GNSS lock with the top facing down.

## Peripheral details

### Thermistor

The Tracker Carrier Board contains a 100K NTC thermistor, connected to A0. It is a [Panasonic ERT-J1VR104FM](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/panasonic-electronic-components/ERT-J1VR104FM/P122067CT-ND/7069667) connected high-side.

![Thermistor](/assets/images/at-som/thermistor.png)

It can be read using the [getTemperature()](/firmware/tracker-edge/tracker-edge-api-reference/#gettemperature-) API. Note that this is the temperature on the board, within the enclosure, and will typically be several degrees warmer than the ambient temperature.

## Design files

The Tracker Carrier Board in the Tracker One is open-source and the Eagle CAD design files are available in GitHub:
