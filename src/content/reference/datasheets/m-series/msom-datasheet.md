### Migration guides

If you are migrating to the M SoM from another Particle device, see also the following migration guides:

- [M SoM from B SoM](/hardware/migration-guides/msom-b-series-migration-guide/)
- [M SoM from Boron or Argon](/hardware/migration-guides/msom-boron-migration-guide/)
- [M SoM from E Series](/hardware/migration-guides/msom-e-series-migration-guide/)
- [M SoM from P2](/hardware/migration-guides/msom-p2-migration-guide/)


### Power

#### VCC

VCC is used to supply power to the cellular module. The recommended input voltage range on this pin is between 3.6V to 4.2V DC. This can be connected directly to a 3.7V LiPo battery. Make sure that the supply can handle currents of at least 2 A.

If you are not using a battery, or using a battery of a different voltage, you should use a regulator to supply 3.7V to 4.2V at 2A. You may want to add additional bulk capacitors to handle the short, high current peak usage when the cellular modem is transmitting.

#### 3V3

3V3 is used to supply power to RTL8722 MCU, logic ICs, memory, etc.. Make sure that the supply can handle a minimum of 500 mA.

These limits do not include any 3.3V peripherals on your base board, so that may increase the current requirements.

{{!-- BEGIN shared-blurb b7c36aca-bdfe-463c-b901-53a3aeec8ab0 --}}
Power supply requirements:
- 3.3V output
- Maximum 5% voltage drop
- 100 mV peak-to-peak ripple maximum
- 500 mA minimum output current at 3.3V recommended for future compatibility
- Maintain these values at no-load as well as maximum load
{{!-- END shared-blurb --}}


### RF

- The M SoM includes three U.FL connectors for external antennas:
  - Cellular 
  - Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) and BLE
  - GNSS (GPS)
- Wi-Fi operation in the 5150-5250 MHz band is only for indoor use to reduce the potential for harmful interference to co-channel mobile satellite systems.
- GNSS features are limited M404 as the cellular modem cannot do cellular communication and GNSS at the same time.

### Approved Antennas

To be provided at a later date.

#### General Antenna Guidance

- The antenna placement needs to follow some basic rules, as any antenna is sensitive to its environment. Mount the antenna at least 10mm from metal components or surfaces, ideally 20mm for best radiation efficiency, and try to maintain a minimum of three directions free from obstructions to be able to operate effectively.
- Needs tuning with actual product enclosure and all components.
 

### Peripherals and GPIO

| Peripheral Type | Qty | Input(I) / Output(O) |
| :---:|:---:|:---:|
| Digital | 30 (max) | I/O |
| Analog (ADC) | 8 (max) | I |
| UART | 2 | I/O |
| SPI  | 2 | I/O |
| I2C  | 1 | I/O |
| USB  | 1 | I/O |
| PWM  | 11 (max) | O |

**Note:** All GPIOs are only rated at 3.3VDC max.

### JTAG and SWD 

The M SoM has 4 pads at the bottom exposing the SWD interface of the MCU. This interface can be used to debug your code or reprogram your SoM bootloader, device OS, or the user firmware. We use 4 pogo-pins connecting to these pads during production for firmware flashing.

{{imageOverlay src="/assets/images/b-series/pogo-pins.png" alt="Pogo Pins"}}

Additionally, SWD is supported on pins on the M.2 connector:

| 55 | D27 | D27 GPIO, SWDIO (SWD_DATA), do not pull down at boot | SWDIO | PA[27] |


{{!-- END do not edit content above, it is automatically generated--}}

- SWD is on the same pins as GPIO, so by default once user firmware boots, SWD is no longer available. This is the same as Gen 2 (STM32) but different than Gen 3 (nRF52840).
- SWO (Serial Wire Output) is not supported on the RTL8722DM.
- Pins 45 and 53 are shared

- All GPIO are 3.3V only and are not 5V tolerant

Certain GPIO will change state at boot, or cause the MCU to enter a special mode. See the [boot mode pins](#boot-mode-pins) section, below, for more information.

- ADC inputs are single-ended and limited to 0 to 3.3V
- Resolution is 12 bits
- SoM pin 45 (A6) on the M SoM is shared with SoM pin 53 (SWD_CLK). You cannot use A6 and SWD at the same time. If you implement SWD on your base board, driving pin A6 will prevent SWD from functioning. The SWD_CLK will be driven at hoot by the MCU.

{{!-- BEGIN shared-blurb 839d8427-884c-4e59-9eee-a267cc4b0e72 --}}
The ADCs on the M SoM (RTL872x) have a lower impedance than other Particle device MCUs (nRF52, STM32F2xx). They require a stronger 
drive and this may cause issues when used with a voltage divider. This is particularly true for A7, which has an even lower impedance 
than other ADC inputs.

For signals that change slowly, such as NTC thermocouple resistance, you can add a 2.2 uF capacitor to the signal. 
For rapidly changing signals, a voltage follower IC can be used.

- The SPI port is 3.3V and must not be connected directly to devices that drive MISO at 5V
- If not using a SPI port, its pins can be used as GPIO
- Any pins can be used as the SPI chip select
- Multiple devices can generally share a single SPI port
- SPI uses the RTL872x SPI1 peripheral (25 MHz maximum speed)

- All available PWM pins on the M SoM share a single timer. This means that they must all share a single frequency, but can have different duty cycles.


### USB

The M SoM supports a USB interface for programming the device and for USB serial (CDC) communications. The module itself does not contain a USB connector; you typically add a micro USB or USB C connector on your base board. It is optional but recommended.

- The CELL USB connector does not need to be populated on your board. It is used for reprogramming the cellular modem firmware, which is rarely done as it often requires recertification of the device.

### RGB LED

The M SoM supports an external common anode RGB LED. 

One common LED that meets the requirements is the 
[Cree CLMVC-FKA-CL1D1L71BB7C3C3](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/cree-inc/CLMVC-FKA-CL1D1L71BB7C3C3/CLMVC-FKA-CL1D1L71BB7C3C3CT-ND/) 
which is inexpensive and easily procured. You need to add three current limiting resistors. With this LED, we typically use 1K ohm current limiting resistors. 
These are much larger than necessary. They make the LED less blinding but still provide sufficient current to light the LEDs. 
If you want maximum brightness you should use the calculated values - 33 ohm on red, and 66 ohm on green and blue.

A detailed explanation of different color codes of the RGB system LED can be found [here](/troubleshooting/led/).

The use of the RGB LED is optional, however it is highly recommended as troubleshooting the device without the LED is very difficult.

{{!-- END do not edit content above, it is automatically generated --}}

- On the M SoM, Pin RGBR (PA[30]) has a 10K hardware pull-up in the module because it's a trap pin that controls the behavior of the internal 1.1V regulator. This does not affect the RGB LED but could affect your design if you are repurposing this pin as GPIO. You must not hold this pin low at boot.

### Boot mode pins

These pins have a special function at boot. Beware when using these pins as input as they can trigger special modes in the MCU.

### SETUP and RESET button

It is highly recommended that you add MODE (SETUP) and RESET buttons to your base board using momentary switches that connect to GND. These are necessary to change the operating mode of the device, for example to enter listening or DFU mode.

{{!-- END do not edit content above, it is automatically generated a4b4a564-7178-4ba6-a98e-7b7ac5c8eeb9 --}}

The MODE button does not have a hardware pull-up on it, so you must add an external pull-up (2.2K to 10K) to 3V3, or connect it to 3V3 if not using a button. 

The RST pin does have an internal weak pull-up, but you may want to add external pull-up on that as well, especially if you use an off-board reset button connected by long wires.

### BLE (Bluetooth LE)

If you wish to use Wi-Fi on the M SoM you will need to provide a way to configure it. Wi-Fi setup works the same as the P2, Photon 2, and Argon, and uses BLE. See [Wi-Fi setup options](/reference/device-os/wifi-setup-options/) for more information.

BLE 5.3 BLE Central Mode and BLE Peripheral Mode are supported. 

Full-speed BLE modes such as A2DP used for BLE audio are not supported.

Wi-Fi and BLE share the same antenna so you do not need to include a separate antenna to use both.

### Sleep

The M SoM can wake from `STOP` or `ULTRA_LOW_POWER` sleep mode on any GPIO, `RISING`, `FALLING`, or `CHANGE`.

The M SoM can only wake from `HIBERNATE` sleep mode on pin A7 (WKP), `RISING`, `FALLING`, or `CHANGE`.

The M SoM preserves the state of outputs during `STOP` or `ULTRA_LOW_POWER` sleep mode. In `HIBERNATE`, outputs are high-impedance.

Most pins can use `INPUT_PULLUP` or `INPUT_PULLDOWN` in sleep modes. The exception is `HIBERNATE` sleep mode where pin D21 can only use an external hardware pull-up or pull down.

### PMIC Notes

{{!-- BEGIN shared-blurb b3247dfa-acbd-4e81-a50d-a5ab68220636 --}}
When using the M SoM with a bq24195 PMIC, note the following:

By default, the bq24195 sets the input current limit, which affects powering by VIN and VUSB, to 100 mA. This affects the VSYS output of the PMIC, which powers both the cellular modem and 3V3 supply, and is not enough to power the M SoM in normal operation.

If your device has the default firmware (Tinker), it will attempt to connect to the cloud, brown out due to insufficient current, then the device will reset. This may result in what appears to be the status LED blinking white, but is actually rolling reboot caused by brownout.

A factory new M SoM does not enable the PMIC setup. To enable the use of the bq21415, you must enable the system power feature [PMIC_DETECTION](/reference/device-os/api/power-manager/systempowerfeature/#systempowerfeature-pmic_detection) in your code. This defaults to off because the M SoM can be used without a PMIC, or with a different PMIC, and also requires I2C on D0/D1, and some base boards may use those pins as GPIO.

Because the input current limit does not affect the battery input (Li+), for troubleshooting purposes it can be helpful to attach a battery to help rule out input current limit issues. It's also possible to supply 3.7V via a bench power supply to the battery input, instead of VIN. 

The input current limit can result in a situation where you can't bring up a M SoM because it browns out continuously, but also cannot flash code to it to stop if from browning out. There are two general solutions:

- Attach a battery or supply by Li+ when bringing up a board.
- Use SWD/JTAG and reset halt the MCU. This will prevent it from connecting to the cloud, so you can flash Device OS and firmware to it by SWD.

The input current limit is actually controlled by three factors:

- The [power source max current setting](/reference/device-os/api/power-manager/powersourcemaxcurrent/) in the PMIC. The default is 900 mA. It can be set to 100, 150, 500, 900, 1200, 1500, 2000, or 3000 mA.
- It is also limited by the hardware ILIM resistor. On Particle devices with a built-in PMIC, this is set to 1590 mA, but if you are implementing your own PMIC hardware, you can adjust this higher.
- When connected by USB, it will use DPDM, current negotiation via the USB DP (D+) and DM (D-) lines. 

Note that some 2A tablet chargers and multi-port USB power supplies supply 2A but do not implement DPDM; these will be treated as if VIN was used, and you must set the power source current, otherwise the input current will be limited to 900 mA, which is not enough to power a 2G/3G cellular modem without an attached battery.

### Mating connector and land pattern

The mating connector is a an M.2 (NGFF) type 4. Note that there are several different key configurations for the M.2, and type 4 is different than is commonly used on SSDs.

One compatible connector is the [TE 2199230-4](https://www.te.com/usa-en/product-2199230-4.html). It is widely available including at suppliers such as [DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/te-connectivity-amp-connectors/2199230-4/A115904CT-ND/4208916).

{{imageOverlay src="/assets/images/b-series/b-series-connector.png" alt="M.2 Connector" class="full-width"}}

---

### Screw Assembly

The M.2 SoM requires a screw to hold the SoM in place because the M.2 connector does not have integrated locks and the SoM will pop up if not attached to the base board. The screw also provides better vibration resistance than locking clips.

- This is one style of standoff.

![Screw Assembly](/assets/images/b-series/new-standoff.png)

- An [alternative design](/hardware/b-series-som/som-first-board/#hold-down-screw) uses a [JAE SM3ZS067U410-NUT1-R1200](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/jae-electronics/SM3ZS067U410-NUT1-R1200/670-2865-1-ND/5955849) standoff. It's reflow soldered to your base board and has a threaded hole for a M2*3 screw to hold down the SoM. This may be easier to obtain.


### Design Considerations

We strongly recommend against placing components under the SOM board because there is not enough height.

{{imageOverlay src="/assets/images/b-series/b-series-keep-out.png" alt="Keep-Out Area"}}

## Product Handling

### ESD Precautions
The M SoM contains highly sensitive electronic circuitry and is an Electrostatic Sensitive Device (ESD). Handling an M SoM without proper ESD protection may destroy or damage it permanently. Proper ESD handling and packaging procedures must be applied throughout the processing, handling and operation of any application that incorporates the M SoM module. ESD precautions should be implemented on the application board where the M SoM is mounted. Failure to observe these precautions can result in severe damage to the M SoM!

### Connectors

The U.FL antenna connector is not designed to be constantly plugged and unplugged. The antenna pin is static sensitive and you can destroy the radio with improper handling. A tiny dab of glue (epoxy, rubber cement, liquid tape or hot glue) on the connector can be used securely hold the plug in place.

The M.2 edge connector is static sensitive and should be handled carefully. The M.2 connector is not designed for repeated removal and insertion of the module.



---

## Default settings

The M SoM comes pre-programmed with a bootloader and a user application called Tinker. This application works with an iOS and Android app also named Tinker that allows you to very easily toggle digital pins, take analog and digital readings and drive variable PWM outputs.

The bootloader allows you to easily update the user application via several different methods, USB, OTA, Serial Y-Modem, and also internally via the Factory Reset procedure. All of these methods have multiple tools associated with them as well.
