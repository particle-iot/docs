## Functional description

### Overview

The P2 is a SMD module with a microcontroller and Wi-Fi networking. The form-factor is the same as the P1, but
the P2 supports 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi, BLE, and has much larger RAM and flash that can support larger applications.

### Features

- 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi, 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz
  - Integrated PCB antenna
  - Integrated U.FL connector for external antenna
  - Integrated RF switch
- BLE 5 using same antenna as Wi-Fi
- Realtek RTL8721DM MCU
  - ARM Cortex M23 CPU, 200 MHz
- 2048 KB (2 MB) user application maximum size
- 2 MB flash file system
- FCC, IC, and CE certified


## Interfaces

{{!-- ### Power --}}

### RF

- The P2 includes an on-module PCB trace antenna and a U.FL connector that allows the user to connect an external antenna.
- The antenna is selected in software. The default is the PCB trace antenna.
- The area surrounding the PCB antenna on the carrier PCB should be free of ground planes and signal traces for maximum Wi-Fi performance when using the trace antenna.
- Device operation in the 5150-5250 MHz band is only for indoor use to reduce the potential for harmful interference to co-channel mobile satellite systems.


### Approved Antennas

In addition to the built-in trace antenna, the following optional external antenna is certified for use with the P2:

| Antenna | SKU  | 
| :------ | :--- |
| Particle P2/Photon2 Wi-Fi Antenna 2.4/5GHz, [x1] | PARANTWM1EA |
| Particle P2/Photon2 Wi-Fi Antenna 2.4/5GHz, [x50] |PARANTWM1TY |

This antenna is used for both Wi-Fi and BLE. In order to use an external antenna, it must be selected in software.

A different dual-band antenna can be used but this will likely require both intentional and unintentional radiator certification.

### SWD/JTAG

The P2 module supports programming and debugging use SWD (Serial Wire Debug) on pins D6 and D7.

| Pin   | JTAG   | MCU Pin | P2 Pin # | Pull at boot |
| :---: | :----: | :-----: | :------: | :----------: |
| D7    | SWDIO  | PA[27]  | 54       | Pull-up      |
| D6    | SWCLK  | PB[3]   | 55       | Pull-down    |
| 3V3   | Power  |         |          |              |
| GND   | Ground |         |          |              |
| RST   | Reset  |         |          |              |

When the bootloader starts, for a brief period of time a weak pull-up is applied to pin D7 and pull-down to pin D6 to detect whether a SWD debugger is attached. After boot, you can use these pins for regular GPIO, but beware of a possible GPIO state change caused by the pull-up or pull-down when using these pins as output.

Note that SWD is shared with GPIO pins D6 and D7, and by default SWD is only enabled while the bootloader is running, immediately at boot, and when in DFU mode (blinking yellow). Only Debug builds in Particle Workbench have SWD enabled in when user firmware is running.

## Memory Map

### Flash Layout Overview

| Address    | File | Purpose |
| :--------- | :--- | :--- |
| 0x00000000 | p2-prebootloader-mbr | This file is factory configured and must never be overwritten |
| 0x00004000 | p2-bootloader | Device OS bootloader |
| 0x00014000 | p2-prebootloader-part1 | Bootloader for KM0 processor, infrequently modified |
| 0x00060000 | p2-system-part1 | Device OS system part |

- The location of the user binary is dependent on the size of the user binary and is not flashed to a fixed location.

- **Do not chip erase the RTL872x under any circumstances!** Also do not flash anything to address 0 (prebootloader-mbr). The prebootloader-mbr is factory configured for your specific device with the private keys necessary for secure boot. If you erase or overwrite this portion of the flash you will not be able to program or use the device again.

### DCT Layout

[This information is from the P1, and is likely to remain the same, but is subject to change.]

The DCT area of flash memory has been mapped to a separate DFU media device so that we can incrementally update the application data. This allows one item (say, server public key) to be updated without erasing the other items.

_DCT layout in `release/stable`_ <a href="https://github.com/particle-iot/device-os/blob/release/v2.x/platform/MCU/STM32F2xx/SPARK_Firmware_Driver/inc/dct.h" target="_blank">found here in firmware.</a>

| reserved2 | 3823 | 435 |

**Note:** Writing 0xFF to offset 34 (DEFAULT) or 3106 (ALTERNATE) will cause the device to re-generate a new private key on the next boot. Alternate keys are currently unsupported on the P1 but are used on the Electron as UDP/ECC keys.  You should not need to use this feature unless your keys are corrupted.

```
// Regenerate Default Keys
echo -en "\xFF" > fillbyte && dfu-util -d 2b04:d00a -a 1 -s 34 -D fillbyte
// Regenerate Alternate Keys
echo -en "\xFF" > fillbyte && dfu-util -d 2b04:d00a -a 1 -s 3106 -D fillbyte
```

- If not using a SPI port, its pins can be used as GPIO
- Any pins can be used as the SPI chip select
- Multiple devices can generally share a single SPI port
- SPI uses the RTL872x SPI1 peripheral (25 MHz maximum speed)
- SPI1 uses the RTL872x SPI0 peripheral (50 MHz maximum speed)


### I2C

The P2 supports one I2C (two-wire serial interface) port.

{{!-- END do not edit content above, it is automatically generated 5b55adb8-1e32-4518-b01e-eadf4e67a262 --}}

- The I2C port is 3.3V and must not be connected directly a 5V I2C bus
- Maximum bus speed is 400 kHz
- External pull-up resistors are required for I2C
- If not using I2C, pins D0 and D1 can be used as GPIO or analog input.


### PWM

The P2 supports PWM (pulse-width modulation) on the following pins:

{{!-- BEGIN do not edit content below, it is automatically generated d68a9c54-a380-11ec-b909-0242ac120002 --}}

| Pin | Pin Name | Description | MCU |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 23 | A5 / D14 | A5 Analog in, GPIO, PWM. | PB[4] |
| 35 | D1 / A4 | D1 GPIO, PWM, I2C SCL, A4 Analog In | PB[5] |
| 40 | S0 / D15 | S0 GPIO, PWM, SPI MOSI, Serial3 TX. (Was P1S0 on P1.) | PA[12] |
| 41 | S1 / D16 | S1 GPIO, PWM, SPI MISO, Serial3 RX. (Was P1S1 on P1.) | PA[13] |
| 49 | A2 / D13 | A2 Analog in, PWM, GPIO | PB[7] |


{{!-- END do not edit content above, it is automatically generated --}}


All available PWM pins on the P2 share a single timer. This means that they must all share a single frequency, but can have different duty cycles.


### USB

The P2 supports a USB interface for programming the device and for USB serial (CDC) communications. The module itself does not contain a USB connector; you typically add a micro USB or USB C connector on your base board. It is optional but recommended.

### RGB LED

The P2 supports an external common anode RGB LED. 

One common LED that meets the requirements is the 
[Cree CLMVC-FKA-CL1D1L71BB7C3C3](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/cree-inc/CLMVC-FKA-CL1D1L71BB7C3C3/CLMVC-FKA-CL1D1L71BB7C3C3CT-ND/) 
which is inexpensive and easily procured. You need to add three current limiting resistors. With this LED, we typically use 1K ohm current limiting resistors. 
These are much larger than necessary. They make the LED less blinding but still provide sufficient current to light the LEDs. 
If you want maximum brightness you should use the calculated values - 33 ohm on red, and 66 ohm on green and blue.

A detailed explanation of different color codes of the RGB system LED can be found [here](/troubleshooting/led/).

The use of the RGB LED is optional, however it is highly recommended as troubleshooting the device without the LED is very difficult.

### Boot mode pins

These pins have a special function at boot. Beware when using these pins as input as they can trigger special modes in the MCU.

| 64 | TX / D8 | Low at boot triggers ISP flash download | PA[7] |


{{!-- END do not edit content above, it is automatically generated --}}


### SETUP and RESET button

It is highly recommended that you add MODE (SETUP) and RESET buttons to your base board using momentary switches that connect to GND. These are necessary to change the operating mode of the device, for example to enter listening or DFU mode.

{{!-- BEGIN do not edit content below, it is automatically generated a4b4a564-7178-4ba6-a98e-7b7ac5c8eeb9 --}}

| Pin | Pin Name | Description | MCU |

| 34 | RST | Hardware reset. Pull low to reset; can leave unconnected in normal operation. | CHIP_EN |
| 46 | MODE | MODE button. Pin number constant is BTN. External pull-up required! | PA[4] |


{{!-- END do not edit content above, it is automatically generated a4b4a564-7178-4ba6-a98e-7b7ac5c8eeb9 --}}

The MODE button does not have a hardware pull-up on it, so you must add an external pull-up (2.2K to 10K) to 3V3, or connect it to 3V3 if not using a button. 

The RST pin does have an internal weak pull-up, but you may want to add external pull-up on that as well, especially if you use an off-board reset button connected by long wires.

### BLE (Bluetooth LE)

BLE Central Mode on the P2 and Photon 2 is only supported in Device OS 5.1.0 and later. Earlier versions only supported BLE Peripheral Mode.

### Sleep

The P2 can wake from `STOP` or `ULTRA_LOW_POWER` sleep mode on any GPIO, `RISING`, `FALLING`, or `CHANGE`.

The P2 can only wake from `HIBERNATE` sleep mode on pin D10, `RISING`, `FALLING`, or `CHANGE`. Pin D10 is the same module pin location (pin 30) as the P1 WKP (A7) pin.

## Mechanical specifications

{{!-- ### Overall dimensions --}}

### Module Dimensions

- P1 module dimensions are: 0.787"(28mm) (W) x 1.102"(20mm) (L) x 0.0787"(2.0mm) (H) +/-0.0039"(0.1mm) (includes metal shielding)
- The P2 should have the same width and length but the height may be slightly different as it has different metal shielding

<div align=center><img src="/assets/images/p1-module-dimensions.png" width=600></div>

### Recommended PCB land pattern

The P2 can be mounted directly on a carrier PCB with following PCB land pattern:

<div align=center><img src="/assets/images/p1-land-pattern.png" width=600px></div>

A P1/P2 part for EAGLE can be found in the [Particle EAGLE library](https://github.com/particle-iot/hardware-libraries#pcb-footprints-land-pattern).

When laying out your board:

- The area in the component keep-out (1) must be free of ground plane, traces, and components on the top or bottom of the board. This will be enforced by Eagle CAD.
- Avoid having a strip of ground plane next to the antenna (2). This is easy to do accidentally, and should be avoided.
- When possible, avoid ground plane in area (3). If you need to put traces or components in this area, it can be done if there is no convenient alternative, but it's best to keep the area close to the antenna as empty as possible for best RF performance.

## Product handling

{{!-- ### Tape and Reel Info --}}

### Moisture sensitivity levels

<i class="icon-attention"></i> The Moisture Sensitivity Level (MSL) relates to the packaging and handling precautions required. The P1 module is rated level 3. In general, this precaution applies for Photons without headers.  When reflowing a P1 directly onto an application PCB, increased moisture levels prior to reflow can damage sensitive electronics on the P1.  A bake process to reduce moisture may be required. <i class="icon-attention"></i>

<i class="icon-right-hand"></i>For more information regarding moisture sensitivity levels, labeling, storage and drying see the MSL standard see IPC/JEDEC J-STD-020 (can be downloaded from [www.jedec.org](http://www.jedec.org)).

### ESD Precautions

<i class="icon-attention"></i> The P1 module contains highly sensitive electronic circuitry and is an Electrostatic Sensitive Device (ESD). Handling a P1 module without proper ESD protection may destroy or damage it permanently.  Proper ESD handling and packaging procedures must be applied throughout the processing, handling and operation of any application that incorporates P1 modules.  ESD precautions should be implemented on the application board where the P1 module is mounted. Failure to observe these precautions can result in severe damage to the P1 module! <i class="icon-attention"></i>

## Default settings

The P2 module comes pre-programmed with a bootloader and a user application called Tinker.  This application works with an iOS and Android app also named Tinker that allows you to very easily toggle digital pins, take analog and digital readings and drive variable PWM outputs.

The bootloader allows you to easily update the user application via several different methods, USB, OTA, Serial Y-Modem, and also internally via the Factory Reset procedure.  All of these methods have multiple tools associated with them as well.

You may use the [Particle Web IDE](https://build.particle.io) to code, compile and flash a user application OTA (Over The Air). [Particle Workbench](/quickstart/workbench/) is a full-featured desktop IDE for Windows, Mac, and Linux based on VSCode and supports both cloud-based and local gcc-arm compiles. The [Particle CLI](/getting-started/developer-tools/cli/) provides a command-line interface for cloud-based compiles and flashing code over USB.

## Intended applications

The P2 module is intended to be used for Wi-Fi based Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications such as environment, weather, HVAC, equipment, and security monitoring. 

The P2 is not certified for use as a wearable device.
