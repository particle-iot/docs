# Particle Boron: LTE + Bluetooth

![Image of the Boron Kit](/assets/images/boron-kit-docs-crop.jpg)

The Boron LTE is a powerful LTE CAT-M1 enabled development kit for cellular networks.

Equipped with the Nordic nRF52840 and u-blox SARA 410 processors, the Boron has built-in battery charging circuitry which makes it easier to connect a Li-Po battery and 20 mixed signal GPIOs to interface with sensors, actuators, and other electronics.

The Boron is great for connecting existing projects to the Particle Device Cloud or as a gateway to connect an entire group of local endpoints where Wi-Fi is missing or unreliable.
