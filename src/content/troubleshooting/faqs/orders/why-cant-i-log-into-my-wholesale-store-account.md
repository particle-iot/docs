## Prerequisites For Access

You will need two things to start placing orders on the wholesale store:

* **Particle Account** \- You need a valid [Particle account](https://login.particle.io/signup) to be able to log in to the wholesale store.
* **Approved Wholesale Account** \- There are three types of wholesale accounts Particle offers: B2B, Distributor, and Particle For Good. See [Wholesale Account Creation](/troubleshooting/faqs/orders/how-do-i-sign-up-for-or-log-into-the-wholesale-store/) to get set up. You will receive a Welcome email from us upon account approval.

## Logging Into The Wholesale Store

Go to the [Wholesale store login page](https://login.particle.io/wholesale) to get started.

When you click "Log In" you should be redirected to the wholesale store.

### If you are not immediately redirected to the store...

* Check to see if you are logged into or are signed up for a [Particle account](https://console.particle.io/)
* Make sure that your wholesale store username matches your Particle account username
* Double-check that you are logging into the [wholesale store](wholesale.particle.io) and **not** our [retail store](store.particle.io)
