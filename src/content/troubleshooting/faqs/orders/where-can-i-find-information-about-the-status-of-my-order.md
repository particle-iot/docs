# {{{title}}}
This document details how a Particle customer can check on the status of their order on our Retail and Wholesale stores. **Broadly, once you place an order, if we have a product that is on allocation or with an extended lead time, it will take our Delivery team 5-7 business days to provide a lead time for your order’s expected delivery date.**

  
Please check which channel you made your purchase on for the appropriate directions below on how you can check on the status of your order. Please note that the interface for the Retail and Wholesale store customers' stores are different, and you will need to determine which store you made your purchase on.   
  
For all **Retail store orders,** your order number on the order confirmation that was emailed to you after purchase **will start with the letter P.**   
  
For all **Wholesale customers,** your order number on the order confirmation that was emailed to you after purchase will **start with the letter W.**

Please see the instructions for each store:

* [Retail Store](https://support.particle.io/hc/en-us/articles/4401990491675#retail)
* [Wholesale Store](https://support.particle.io/hc/en-us/articles/4401990491675#wholesale)
