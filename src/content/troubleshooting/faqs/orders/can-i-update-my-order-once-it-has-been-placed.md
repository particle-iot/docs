## Order Update Policy

Our goal is to ship your order to you as quickly as possible once it is placed. Because of this, we are unable to make changes to your order once it is placed. This includes, but is not limited to, updating the quantity of products ordered, adding or removing products to your order, changing your shipping address, requesting to split ship items and changing your billing address. We are also unable to cancel an order once it is placed, so please be sure to review your cart carefully prior to checking out.

If your order has a lead time associated with it, our support team may still be able to make changes. Please reach out to us for assistance by submitting a ticket [here](https://support.particle.io/hc/en-us/requests/new)!
