- *Please note that because of COVID-19 and the impact it has had on sourcing and manufacturing, some of our former standard manufacturing lead times have been extended.
- Lead times apply only from the point of payment. 
- Requesting a lead time will not reserve stock. 
- Only a committed, non-refundable, non-cancellable purchase order (PO) or a purchase with payment will guarantee lead times. 
- Particle reserves the right to increase or decrease lead times at any time.
