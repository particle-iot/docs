## Overview

If you live outside of the United States and placed an order through either our retail or wholesale store, you might be wondering what additional steps there are before you receive your package from us. Hopefully, the information here can help you better understand our international shipping policies.

## Customs Fees and Other Charges

Our primary logistics facility is based in Las Vegas, Nevada USA which means that any order shipped outside of the United States may be subject to customs fees, tariffs, or additional import charges. Per international shipping regulations, these fees will be charged based on the MSRP - the retail value - of the product. By placing your order through one of our stores, you are agreeing to cover any of the international fees you might incur. If you are placing your order for Particle products through one of our third-party distributors, please review the distributor's shipping documentation for more information on their international shipping policies.

## International Shipment Documentation

Every order shipped outside of the United States will be packed with a Commercial Invoice that will contain all of the necessary information for clearing customs. This information includes but is not limited to:

* AWB/Tracking Number
* Shipper Information
* Consignee Information
* Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS/HS) code
* Value of goods
* Quantity of goods
* Description of goods
* Country of Origin

If your order is missing this commercial invoice or if any of the information on the commercial invoice does not match the information you recall from your checkout process, please reach out to our team so we can better assist you.
