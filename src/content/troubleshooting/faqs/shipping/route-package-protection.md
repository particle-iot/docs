We've partnered with [Route](https://route.com/), a package protection and tracking solution, to give our customers the best possible delivery experience. Route provides low-cost shipping protection to protect your package in the event that it gets lost, stolen, or damaged while in transit.

Route has a mobile app that allows you to visually track all of your online orders in one place. No need to dig through your email for tracking numbers. Route's dynamic maps and real-time shipping updates keep you in the loop throughout every part of your delivery. The Route app is available on Android and Apple app stores.

If your original order was insured by Route and you are experiencing an issue with your order or delivery, please file a claim on the [Route claims page](https://claims.route.com/).

By opting out of package protection during the checkout process, Particle is not liable for lost, damaged, or stolen items once the shipment has left our warehouse.
