When purchasing products from our stores, you will be able to choose between various shipping methods. The shipping options you see at checkout will vary depending on your location and the weights/value of your order. The two sections below will provide you with a general understanding of the shipping options we offer:

Each shipping option will also show you the approximate delivery timeline from when your order ships. Please note order processing is between 2-4 business days and is in addition to the delivery timelines. If an item you've ordered is out of stock, you will see lead time information upon adding the item to your cart and checking out in our Wholesale Store. Your entire order will be shipped when all items are in stock and available. 

## Domestic shipping options

If you are ordering within the contiguous United States, then you should generally see the below shipping options available to you at checkout:

* Economy (approx. 7 business days)
* Standard (approx. 5 business days)
* Expedited (approx. 3 business days)
* Express (approx. 2 business days)

Orders will ship within 2-4 business days of placement if they are in-stock. If any item on your order is back-ordered, then your order will not ship until all items are in-stock and available. You will see an estimated lead time both on an out-of-stock product page and at checkout in our wholesale store. Our team will also contact you with an estimated ship date once we can better confirm one for you. If you place an order through our retail store, then your order will generally ship within 2-4 business days.

## International shipping options

If you live anywhere other than the 48 contiguous United States, then you will see more specific shipping options available to you at checkout. International orders may also be subject to additional charges, which are outlined for you [here](/troubleshooting/faqs/shipping/if-my-order-is-shipping-to-a-country-outside-of-the-united-states-what-do-i-need-to-know/). Below are shipping options you may see for your order at checkout:

* UPS Worldwide Expedited (approx. 3-6 business days)
* UPS Worldwide Saver (approx. 2-4 business days)
* UPS Worldwide Express (approx. 2-4 business days)
* DHL Express (approx. 3-6 business days)

Shipping options available to you will vary depending on your location and the weights/value of your order. Please note, order processing timelines for international orders may take up to 5 business days due to additional customs documentation, which is in addition to shipping timelines noted above.
