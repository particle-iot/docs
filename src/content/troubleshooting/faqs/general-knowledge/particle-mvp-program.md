### Are MVPs paid to promote Particle services and products?

No. Particle MVPs are community members and independent engineers who work with Particle products on a regular basis. They are not compensated for promoting or using our products, though they may be reimbursed or sponsored by Particle if attending or presenting at an event on our behalf.

### How can I become an MVP?

To join the program, you need to be referred by a Particle employee or an existing Particle MVP.
