## MVP Program faq

Before reading this FAQ, you may want to familiarize yourself with the [Particle MVP Program overview](https://www.particle.io/mvp-program/) on the Particle website.

### Are MVPs Particle employees?

### Are MVPs paid to promote Particle services and products?

No. Particle MVPs are community members and independent engineers who work with Particle products on a regular basis. They are not compensated for promoting or using our products, though they may be reimbursed or sponsored by Particle if attending or presenting at an event on our behalf.

### Who are the current MVPs?

Our MVP Program is a living group, with members being added twice a year. For the latest list of MVPs, visit the [MVP program page](https://www.particle.io/mvp-program/) on our website.

### How can I become an MVP?

To join the program, you need to be referred by a Particle employee or an existing Particle MVP.
