Here are some best practices when setting up 2FA for your Particle accout.

First, and most importantly, **save the ten one-time recovery passcodes that are provided** \-- but do _not_ rely on storing them on your mobile device. We recommend printing them out and keeping them in a secure location away from your computer.

Some authenticator mobile apps store account credentials on the mobile device itself ([Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en%5Fus) works this way). That means that **if you lose or replace your mobile device, you will no longer be able to log into your Particle account unless you have one of the one-time recovery passcodes mentioned above**. So if you know that youâ€™re going to be replacing your mobile device, first disable 2FA on your Particle account, and then re-enable it using your new device.

Some other authenticator apps (e.g. [Authy](https://authy.com/features/) and 1Password) store credentials in their cloud, so they are not as problematic when a mobile device is replaced.
