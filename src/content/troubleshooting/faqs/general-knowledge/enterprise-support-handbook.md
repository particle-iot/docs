# {{{title}}}
We endeavor to provide our Enterprise customers the highest level of customer satisfaction focused on timeliness and quality of solutions and services. As such, we would like to outline our customer support commitments in 3 areas:

1. Access to on-demand online resources
2. Customer support service targets and expectations
3. Product service notifications

### Access to on-demand online resources

Our self help resources provide the most complete and up-to-date resources at support.particle.io. From Borons to Billing, you will find information on technical and product operation resources that is available on-demand anytime.

In addition, our developer community offers extensive information and advice sourced by practical examples from our Particle power-users. Participate and learn from other experts in our forums at <community.particle.io>

### Customer support service targets and expectations

To request additional support, use the enterprise email alias that has been created to receive your requests \[customer company name\]@particle.io. This will generate a ticket in our support system.
