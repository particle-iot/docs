You may change the email address associated with your account at any time by going [clicking this link](https://login.particle.io/account-info?redirect=https://console.particle.io/devices) and typing in the new email address. You may also log into your account at <console.particle.io> and click on your email address in the top right and select the “Edit Account” option from the dropdown menu.

You will find your current email address in the main field at the top; edit the field to the new desired address and you will be prompted with your password again to allow changes.

You must then click on the update button to confirm changes to your account. You can only change your account email address to an email that does not already have a Particle account associated with it.
