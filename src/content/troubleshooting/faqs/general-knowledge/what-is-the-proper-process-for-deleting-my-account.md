In order to delete your account, log into your account at <console.particle.io> and perform the following actions:

* Remove the SIM(s) from both your account and any Products owned by the account. (**Release** them, don’t just Deactivate them.)
* Unclaim your Device(s) from both your account and any Products owned by the account. (Releasing a SIM does not remove the associated device from your account, and vice-versa)
* Delete all Integrations (Webhooks etc.) from your account and any Products owned by the account

Also, as necessary, be sure to back up any source files you have stored in the [Web IDE](https://build.particle.io/build/new).

Click on your email address in the top right and select the “Edit Account” option from the dropdown menu. You will be redirected to <https://login.particle.io/account-info?redirect=https://console.particle.io/devices>. Select the “delete account” option near the center-bottom of the page. You will be prompted to enter your password one more time to confirm the deletion of your account.

 (_Note_ that **this action is non-reversible**, so be very sure that you really want the account deleted.)
