If you have lost/replaced your mobile device and also do not have any of the one-time recovery passcodes at hand, you will have to submit a support request by submitting a ticket via the ticket submission button (<support.particle.io> landing page).

In order for us to authenticate you (i.e. ensure that you are the actual account owner), **we will need you to submit in your support request the last four digits and expiry date of the credit card associated with your account.**

If you do not have a credit card associated with your account, please include as many of the following as you can in your support request: 

* Number and type of device(s) claimed to your account
* Name(s) and Device IDs ([link for information about how to find Device IDs](/troubleshooting/guides/device-management/finding-your-device-id/)) of devices claimed to your account
* Name(s) of user firmware sketches stored in the Web IDE
* Any other data that will help us determine that you are in fact the account owner

**Important** \- please note that this process may take upwards of 1 business day to resolve, and will require at least one back-and-forth with a Support Agent via your registered Particle email address.
