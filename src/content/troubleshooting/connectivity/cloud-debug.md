# Cloud Debug

**In most cases, using the [Particle Web Device Doctor](/tools/doctor/) will be easier than using Cloud Debug directly.**


## Manual installation

You should really use [Web Device Doctor](/tools/doctor/) as it is able to do both device-side and cloud-side checks from one user interface, but if you prefer to install manually or do not have a compatible browser or computer, you can flash appropriate binary below to your device manually.

Note that the Device OS version is the minimum device OS version that must be installed to use that binary. It's OK if your device already has a newer version of Device OS. If your device has an older version of Device OS you should upgrade it first, or use the Web Device Doctor that will handle updating Device OS if necessary.

## Viewing the results

If you are using a Chrome browser you can monitor the output here by connecting to your device using the web serial debug monitor:

{{> usb-serial-console}}

Otherwise, you can use the Particle CLI command:

```
particle serial monitor
```
