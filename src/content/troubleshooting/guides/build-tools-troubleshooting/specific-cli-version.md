The Particle CLI should be installed using the [Particle CLI installer](/getting-started/developer-tools/cli).

Prior to September, 2023, the `particle update` command installed the latest LTS version at the time the CLI version was released. Thus if you wanted to install an older version of Device OS you had to downgrade the CLI. This is no longer necessary as the `--target` option can be used to install a specific version instead.

Support for discontinued platforms like the Spark Core no longer exists in the current version of the CLI, so you may want to use an older version of the CLI to do things like flash the cc3000 update, however.

### Installation

The current source for the Particle CLI can be found [in Github](https://github.com/particle-iot/particle-cli) and the release notes can be found [here](https://github.com/particle-iot/particle-cli/releases). The release notes can help you determine which version of the CLI you need.

Some versions of interest:

- If you need to use older platforms such as Redbear Duo and Core, use v2 (v2.16.0, currently).


To replace the existing `particle` command you can use:

```
npm install -g particle-cli@3.2.0
```

Or, for the latest CLI 2.x version (currently 2.16.0):

```
npm install -g particle-cli@2
```

To restore the current version of the Particle CLI you can use:

```
npm uninstall -g particle-cli
particle --update-cli
```

Also note that the Particle CLI current requires node v16. It does not work with node v18 and later. Using a node version manager like nvm or fnm is recommended so you can switch between version if necessary. This is only necessary when using a source build, not when using the Particle CLI installer.

### Mac with Apple silicon

If you are using a Mac with Apple silicon (M1, M2, M3, ...) and have previously imported your settings and applications from an Intel Mac see [CLI on Mac with Apple silicon](/troubleshooting/guides/build-tools-troubleshooting/cli-mac-apple-silicon/) for additional information. These steps should not be necessary if using the CLI installer.

## Windows installer historical versions

The link above will download the latest version of the Windows installer for the Particle CLI. If for some reason you need to install and older
version you can download previous versions here. We recommend that you always install the latest version, as there is no longer any association
between CLI and version and Device OS versions.

## Mac OS or Linux installer historical version

To install a specific version of the CLI on Mac OS or Linux, specify the `VERSION` environment variable.

VERSION=3.23.4 && bash <( curl -sL https://particle.io/install-cli )

The available version numbers are the same as the Windows installer historical versions, above.
