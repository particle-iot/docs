## Installing curl (for Windows)

The curl command, used in the [Particle cloud examples](https://docs.particle.io/reference/api/) is generally built-in on the Mac and Linux, but not Windows. These instructions explain how to install it.

### Installation

#### Download

Download the files from <https://curl.haxx.se/download.html>. You generally want one of the two highlighted files, depending on whether you have 32-bit or 64-bit Windows:

* Win32 Generic - Win32 zip 7.51.0 binary SSL SSH
* Win64 Generic - Win64 x86\_64 zip 7.51.0 binary SSL SSH

Click on the version number (7.51.0, for example) to download the file.

If you are unsure, this Microsoft knowledge base article on [how to tell whether you have a 32-bit or 64-bit Windows installation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/827218) may be helpful.

You should also go to the page <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html>. Right click on the link to cacert.pem and select **Save Target** to save the file to your Downloads folder.

![Save Target](/assets/images/support/installing-curl-02savetarget.png)

You first need to create a place to save your curl installation. I like to put the files in C:\\Program Files\\curl. In the Windows File Explorer:

1. Select This PC
2. Select your C: drive, called **Windows 10 (C:)** in this example, but your may be different.
3. Double click Program Files

![Create folder in program files](/assets/images/support/installing-curl-10programfiles.png)

Right click on the right side of the window, select **New** then **Folder**.

![Create folder in program files](/assets/images/support/installing-curl-11newfolder.png)

Name the new folder **curl**. Then moved the files you downloaded into this directory.

![Create curl directory in program files](/assets/images/support/installing-curl-03curldir.png)

Open the .zip file that you downloaded earlier. Inside the **src** folder should be the file **curl.exe**. Copy this into the new directory that you just created.

![Copy curl.exe](/assets/images/support/installing-curl-04copy.png)

Also copy the **cacert.pem.htm** file into the curl directory.

![Copy cacert.pem.htm](/assets/images/support/installing-curl-05copy.png)

Rename the **cacert.pem.htm** file to **curl-ca-bundle.crt**. You should get a warning about changing the filename extension. Click **Yes**.

![Rename cacert.pem.htm](/assets/images/support/installing-curl-06rename.png)

Depending on your system settings, the filename extension may be hidden. This will cause some problems. You can tell because the the curl program is just **curl** not **curl.exe** and also **cacert.pem** is of type **HTML Document**.

![No filename extensions](/assets/images/support/installing-curl-07noextension.png)

One way to fix this is to just turn on filename extension viewing. Open the **Control Panel** and select **Appearance and Personalization**.

![Apperance](/assets/images/support/installing-curl-08appearance.png)

Then **Folder Options**.

![Folder Options](/assets/images/support/installing-curl-09folderoptions.png)

Click the **View** tab (1) and then deselect the checkbox for **Hide extensions for known file types** (2).

![Hide Extension](/assets/images/support/installing-curl-10hideext.png)

Then you can finally rename the file **curl-ca-bundle.crt** and have it show up as type **Security Certificate**.

#### Editing the path - Windows 10

Click on the Windows Start menu, then the Settings (gear icon).

![Start Settings](/assets/images/support/installing-curl-13startsettings.png)

In the Windows 10 Settings window, type **environment** into the box at the top and select **Edit the system environment variables.**

![Settings](/assets/images/support/installing-curl-14settings.png)

Click the **Environment Variables** button at the bottom of the page.

![Enviroment Variables](/assets/images/support/installing-curl-15environmentvariables.png)

In the **Environment Variables** window, select **Path** in the bottom list (System variables) and click Edit.

![Edit](/assets/images/support/installing-curl-16edit.png)

In the **Edit environment variable** window, click **New** then enter a new row in the table, **C:\\Program Files\\curl**.

![Edit New](/assets/images/support/installing-curl-17editnew.png)

After editing the system path environment variable you'll need to restart the computer.

#### Editing the path - Windows 7 and 8

You need to open the Control Panel.

![Open Control Panel](/assets/images/support/installing-curl-05controlpanel.png)

And then click on **System and Security**.

![System and Security](/assets/images/support/installing-curl-06systemandsecurity.png)

Then click **System**.

![System and Secury](/assets/images/support/installing-curl-18system.png)

Then click on the **Advanced System Settings** link on the left side of the window.

![Advanced Settings](/assets/images/support/installing-curl-08advanced.png)

Then click on **Environment Variables...**

![Environment](/assets/images/support/installing-curl-09environment.png)

Click on **Path** in the bottom list (System variables) and click Edit.

Finally, position the cursor at the end of the box and add to the end:

```
;C:\Program Files\curl

```

There must be a semicolon separating the new item from the previous last item, and then the path to the directory we just created.

![Edit variable](/assets/images/support/installing-curl-19editvar.png)

After editing the system path environment variable you'll need to restart the computer or log out and log back in.

### Testing

Most calls require an access token. At CLI, you can create by using

particle token create

Make sure you keep your token secret, because it allows access and control over all of your devices.

You should now be able to open a Command Prompt window and type in a command like:

```
curl https://api.particle.io/v1/devices?access_token=PASTE_YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE

```

Also note: Many of the examples show a command that continues across lines with a backslash (\\) at the end of the line. This is the correct character for Mac and Linux, but using the Windows Command Prompt you should use the carat (^) instead.
