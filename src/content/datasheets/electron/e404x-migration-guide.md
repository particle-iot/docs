# E404X Migration Guide

**Preliminary pre-release version 2022-01-25**

This guide assists in the transition from the E Series E402/E404 to the E404X.


## Hardware 

### No 5V tolerance!

On Gen 2 devices (STM32F205), most pins are 5V tolerant. This is not the case for the E404X and Gen 3 (nRF52840). You must not exceed 3.3V on any GPIO pin, including ports such as serial, I2C, and SPI.

### Pins A3, A4, and DAC (A6)

Pins A3 (module pin 22), A4 (module pin 21), DAC/A6 (module pin 24) do not exist on the P2 and are NC.

You will need to use different pins if you are currently using these pins.

### SPI

Both the P1 and P2 have two SPI ports, however the pins are different for `SPI` (primary SPI).

**TODO: Update this table for Gen 3**

|      | P1    | P2 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| SPI SCK  | A3 | D20 / S2 |
| SPI MISO | A4 | D19 / S1 |
| SPI MOSI | A5 | D18 / S0 |

The following are all SPI-related pins on the P1 and P2:

#### SPI - Gen 2 devices (including P1)

**TODO: Update this table for Gen 3**

| | SPI | SPI1 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Maximum rate | 30 MHz | 15 MHz |
| Default rate | 15 MHz | 15 MHz |
| Clock | 60 MHz | 30 MHz |

- Available clock divisors: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256

#### SPI - P2 

**TODO: Update this table for Gen 3**

| | SPI | SPI1 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Maximum rate | 25 MHz | 50 MHz |
| Hardware peripheral | RTL872x SPI1 | RTL872x SPI0 |



### Serial (UART)


The primary UART serial (`Serial1`) is on the TX and RX pins on both the P1 and P2. There is no hardware flow control on this port on the P1 or P2.

The secondary UART serial (`Serial2`) is on different pins, however it does not conflict with the RGB LED, and also supports CTS/RTS hardware flow control.

### Analog input (ADC)

For analog to digital conversion (ADC) using `analogRead()`, there are fewer ADC inputs on the E404X:

### PWM (Pulse-width modulation)

The pins that support PWM are different on the E Series and E404X.

{{!-- END do not edit content above, it is automatically generated 0fc429e8-585e-4f36-9874-e3fa37a1136e --}}

- PWM on the same timer must share the same frequency, but can have different duty cycles.
- Pin B2 uses PWM0 which is used by the RGB LED. You can have a different duty cycle but should not change the frequency if you are using the RGB LED.


### Digital to analog converter (DAC)

The E Series supports DAC one A3 and A6 (DAC). There is no DAC on the E404X or Gen 3 devices.

If you need a DAC, it's easy to add one via I2C or SPI on your base board.

{{!-- END do not edit content above, it is automatically generated 2ee8f339-68a5-4d9c-b6b9-0f359038d704 --}}



### WKP (A7)

|              | E Series    | E404X |
| :----------- | :---------: | :---: |
| Module Pin   | 30          | 30 |
| Pin Name     | WKP         | WKP |
|              | A7          | A7 |
| Analog Input | &check;     | &check; |
| PWM          | &check;     |  |

On Gen 2 devices (STM32), only the WKP pin can wake from HIBERNATE sleep mode. 

This restriction does not exist on the E404X and Gen 3 devices; any pin can be used to wake from all sleep modes.

### CAN (Controller Area Network)

The E series supported CAN on pins D1/D2 or C4/C5. There is no CAN on the E404X or Gen 3 devices (except the Tracker).

- The Tracker SoM includes CAN via a MCP25625 CAN interface with integrated transceiver.
- Both the MCP2515 and MCP25625 work with [the library](https://github.com/particle-iot/can-mcp25x) used on the Tracker and can be used to add CAN to the E404X.

### I2S (Sound)

The E Series theoretically had I2S sound available on pins D1 and D2, however there has never been support for it in Device OS.

I2S is available on Gen 3 devices including the P404X on any GPIO pins using a 3rd-party library.


### Interrupts

There are many limitations for interrupts on the STM32F205. All pins can be used for interrupts on Gen 3 devices and the E404X.

### Pin functions removed

The following pins were used on the E Series but are not available on the E404X. You should not connect anything to these pins.

## Software


### Third-party libraries

Most third-party libraries are believed to be compatible. The exceptions include:

- Libraries that use peripherals that are not present (such as DAC)
- Libraries for MCU-specific features (such as ADC DMA)
- Libraries that are hardcoded to support only certain platforms by their PLATFORM_ID

Since the E404X uses the same MCU as Gen 3 devices (Boron, B Series SoM, Tracker SoM), most libraries intended for those platforms will work with no changes or minimal changes.
