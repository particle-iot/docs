### Power
The E series can be powered via the VIN (3.88V-12VDC) pin, over USB, or a LiPo battery.

#### VIN
The input voltage range on VIN pin is 3.88VDC to 12VDC. When powering from the VIN pin alone, make sure that the power supply is rated at 10W (for example 5 VDC at 2 Amp). If the power source is unable to meet this requirement, you'll need connect the LiPo battery as well.  An additional bulk capacitance of 470uF to 1000uF should be added to the VIN input when the LiPo Battery is disconnected.  The amount of capacitance required will depend on the ability of the power supply to deliver peak currents to the cellular modem.

The E Series LTE (E402, LTE Cat M1) can be powered with as little as 550 mA at 5V.

#### LiPo
This pin serves two purposes. You can use this pin to connect a LiPo battery directly without having to use a JST connector or it can be used to connect an external DC power source (and this is where one needs to take extra precautions). When powering it from an external regulated DC source, the  recommended input voltage range on this pin is between 3.6V to 4.4VDC. Make sure that the supply can handle currents of at least 3Amp. This is the most efficient way of powering the E series since the PMIC by-passes the regulator and supplies power to the E series module via an internal FET leading to lower quiescent current.

When powered from a LiPo battery alone, the power management IC switches off the internal regulator and supplies power to the system directly from the battery. This reduces the conduction losses and maximizes battery run time. The battery provided with the E series module is a Lithium-Ion Polymer battery rated at 3.7VDC 1,800mAh. You can substitute this battery with another 3.7V LiPo with higher current rating. Remember to never exceed this voltage rating and always pay attention to the polarity of the connector.

Typical current consumption is around 180mA and up to 1.8A transients at 5VDC. In deep sleep mode, the quiescent current is 130uA (powered from the battery alone).

#### VBUS
This pin is internally connected to USB supply rail and will output 5V when the E series module is plugged into an USB port. It is intentionally left unpopulated. This pin will _NOT_ output any voltage when the E series module is powered via VIN and/or the LiPo battery.

Most USB ports can supply only a maximum of 500mA, but the u-Blox GSM module on the E series alone can consume a peak of 800mA to 1800mA (2G/3G) or 550 mA (LTE Cat M1) of current during transmission. In order to compensate of this deficit, one must connect the LiPo battery at all times when powering from a traditional USB port for 2G/3G. The E series will intelligently source power from the USB most of the time and keep the battery charged. During peak current requirements, the additional power will be sourced from the battery. This reduces the charge-discharge cycle load on the battery, thus improving its longevity.

#### 3V3 Pin
This pin is the output of the on-board 3.3V switching regulator that powers the microcontroller and the peripherals. This pin can be used as a 3.3V power source with a max load of 800mA. Unlike the Photon or the Core, this pin _CANNOT_ be used as an input to power the E series module.

#### VDDA
Unlike the Electron, the E series module exposes the VDDA pin of the STM32 microcontroller separately. This pin powers the ADC block of the microcontroller. A maximum difference of 300 mV between VDD (in this case, 3V3) and VDDA can be tolerated during power-up and power-down operation. Under normal operations, connect the VDDA to 3V3 pin of the E0. Be sure to connect VDDA even if you are not using any analog circuitry; the device will fail to boot if not powered.

#### VBAT
This is the supply to the internal RTC, backup registers and SRAM. You can connect a backup battery to it (1.65 to 3.6VDC), if you wish to retain RTC/RAM when 3V3 is absent or simply tie it up to 3V3.

#### PMID
This pin is the output of the internal boost regulator of the PMIC that can source 5.1VDC from the battery in OTG (On The Go) mode. This feature is useful when your circuitry needs a 5V source from the E series module when powered by the battery alone.

The confusing bit about this pin is that it will continue to provide 5.1VDC but only when the input voltage (VIN) is between 3.6V to 5.1VDC. As soon as the input voltage exceeds this limit, the PMID starts tracking _that_ voltage. For example if VIN = 9VDC, the PMID will be 9VDC and _NOT_ 5.1VDC. So you need to be careful when using it as a source for powering your external circuitry. The max current draw on this pin is 2.1A but is not recommended due to thermal limitations of the circuit board.

### Peripherals and GPIO

| Peripheral Type | Qty | Input(I) / Output(O) | FT<sup>[1]</sup> / 3V3<sup>[2]</sup> |
| :---:|:---:|:---:|:---: |
| Digital | 30 | I/O | FT/3V3 |
| Analog (ADC) | 12 | I | 3V3 |
| Analog (DAC) | 2 | O | 3V3 |
| UART | 3 | I/O | 3V3 |
| SPI  | 2 | I/O | 3V3 |
| I2S  | 1 | I/O | 3V3 |
| I2C  | 1 | I/O | FT |
| CAN  | 2 | I/O | 3V3<sup>[4]</sup> |
| USB  | 1 | I/O | 3V3 |
| PWM  | 13<sup>3</sup> | O | 3V3 |

**Notes:**
<sup>[1]</sup> FT = 5.0V tolerant pins. All pins except A3 and DAC are 5V tolerant (when not in analog mode). If used as a 5V input the pull-up/pull-down resistor must be disabled.

<sup>[2]</sup> 3V3 = 3.3V max pins.

<sup>[3]</sup> PWM is available on D0, D1, D2, D3, B0, B1, B2, B3, A4, A5, WKP, RX, TX with a caveat: PWM timer peripheral is duplicated on two pins (A5/D2) and (A4/D3) for 11 total independent PWM outputs. For example: PWM may be used on A5 while D2 is used as a GPIO, or D2 as a PWM while A5 is used as an analog input. However A5 and D2 cannot be used as independently controlled PWM outputs at the same time.

<sup>[4]</sup> Technically these pins are 5.0V tolerant, but since you wouldn't operate them with a 5.0V transceiver it's proper to classify them as 3.3V.


### JTAG AND SWD
Pin D3 through D7 are JTAG interface pins. These can be used to reprogram your E series module bootloader or user firmware image with standard JTAG tools such as the ST-Link v2, J-Link, R-Link, OLIMEX ARM-USB-TINI-H, and also the FTDI-based Particle JTAG Programmer. If you are short on available pins, you may also use SWD mode which requires less pins.

| E series module Pin | JTAG | SWD | STM32F205RGT6 Pin | Default Internal<sup>[1]</sup> |
| :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| D7 | JTAG_TMS | SWD/SWDIO| PA13 | ~40k pull-up |
| D6 | JTAG_TCK | CLK/SWCLK| PA14 | ~40k pull-down |
| D5 | JTAG_TDI | |PA15 | ~40k pull-up |
| D4 | JTAG_TDO | |PB3 | Floating |
| D3 | JTAG_TRST | |PB4 | ~40k pull-up |
| 3V3 | Power | || |
| GND | Ground| || |
| RST | Reset | || |


**Notes:**
[1] Default state after reset for a short period of time before these pins are restored to GPIO (if JTAG debugging is not required, i.e. `USE_SWD_JTAG=y` is not specified on the command line.)

## Memory Map

### STM32F205RGT6 Flash Layout Overview

- Bootloader (16 KB)
- DCD1 (16 KB), stores keys, mfg info, system flags, etc..
- DCD2 (16 KB), swap area for DCD1
- EEPROM emulation bank 1 (16 KB)
- EEPROM emulation bank 2 (64 KB) [only 16k used]

### DCD Layout

The DCD area of flash memory has been mapped to a separate DFU media device so that we can incrementally update the application data. This allows one item (say, server public key) to be updated without erasing the other items.

_DCD layout as of v0.4.9_ [found here in firmware](https://github.com/particle-iot/device-os/blob/develop/platform/MCU/STM32F2xx/SPARK_Firmware_Driver/inc/dct.h)

| alt server public key | 3298 | 192 |
| alt server address | 3490 | 128 |
| reserved2 | 3618 | 1280 |

**Note:** Writing 0xFF to offset 3106 (DEFAULT key used on E series module) will cause the device to re-generate a new private UDP/ECC key on the next boot. TCP keys are currently unsupported on the E series module but would be located at offset 34.  You should not need to use this feature unless your keys are corrupted.

```
// Regenerate Alternate Keys (Default)
echo -en "\xFF" > fillbyte && dfu-util -d 2b04:d00a -a 1 -s 3106 -D fillbyte
// Regenerate TCP Keys (Unsupported)
echo -en "\xFF" > fillbyte && dfu-util -d 2b04:d00a -a 1 -s 34 -D fillbyte
```

### LED Status

#### Charge status LED

|State | Description |
|:---|:---|
|ON | Charging in progress |
|OFF | Charging complete |
|Blink at 1Hz| Fault condition<sup>[1]</sup> |
|Rapid blinking | Battery disconnected<sup>[2]</sup> |

**Notes:**

<sup>[1]</sup> A fault condition can occur due to several reasons, for example, battery over/under voltage, temperature fault or safety timer fault. You can find the root cause by reading the fault register of the power management IC in firmware.

<sup>[2]</sup> You can stop this behavior by either plugging in the LiPo battery or by disabling the charging using the appropriate firmware command.

#### System RGB LED

Unlike the Electron, the E series module does not have an on-board RGB status LED. We have provided its individual control pins for you to connect an LED of your liking. This will allow greater flexibility in the end design of your products.

For a detailed explanation of different color codes of the RGB system LED, please take a look [here.](/tutorials/device-os/led/electron/)

Note that LTE is LTE Cat M1, not the standard LTE (LTE Cat 1) used by your mobile phone. It is a low-power and low-data-rate variation of LTE for use with IoT devices. It can only be used in the United States, Canada. and Mexico at this time.

For a complete list of carriers and supported countries, see the [carrier guide](/tutorials/cellular-connectivity/cellular-carriers/).

## Schematics

### USB

<div align=center><img src="/assets/images/e-series/schematics/e0-usb-sch.png"></div>

The USB data lines are terminated with 22 Ohm resistors. These data pins are also exposed via small through holes next to the USB connector and are labeled D+ and D-. The VBUS (+5VDC VCC of the USB port) is fed to the PMIC via a 3Amp Schottky diode ([SS3P3](http://www.vishay.com/docs/88944/ss3p3.pdf)). The VBUS pin is also available via the unpopulated header hole on the top-right side of the E series.

### PMIC (Power Management Integrated Circuit)

<div align=center><img src="/assets/images/e-series/schematics/e0-pmic-sch.png"></div>

The E series uses TI's [BQ24195](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/bq24195.pdf) as the power management and charging unit. This PMIC intelligently sources power from either the VIN pin, the USB port and/or the LiPo battery. When all the power sources as connected, the unit tries to source power from the USB or VIN as default and continues to charge the LiPo battery. When the battery is completely charged, the power is then sourced from USB/VIN alone. If there is a power deficit (which generally occurs during cellular radio transmission), the additional power is then sourced from the battery as required. The unit can also seamlessly switch back to the battery when other sources of power are suddenly removed.

The DP data pin of the USB is used by the PMIC to detect the presence of a USB power source. It then adjusts the charge current and the limit based on the type of USB power source it detects. This does not always happen successfully since there are a lot of USB hubs and chargers out there that do not meet the USB design guidelines. If the detection is unsuccessful, the PMIC defaults to a 500mA current limit. A user can always adjust these parameters via software.

The microcontroller communicates with the PMIC via an I2C interface (pins PC9 and PA8). This interface allows the microcontroller to read the status of the PMIC and set its various parameters.

### Microcontroller

<div align=center><img src="/assets/images/e-series/schematics/e0-micro-sch.png"></div>

The E series uses ST Microelectronics's STM32F205RGT6 ARM Cortex M3 microcontroller running at  120MHz.

---

### U-blox cellular module

<div align=center><img src="/assets/images/e-series/schematics/e0-ublox-sch.png"></div>

The u-blox cellular module talks to the microcontroller over a full-duplex USART interface using a standard set of AT commands. The MFF2 embedded SIM chip is directly connected to the u-blox module. 

The MFF2 SMD SIM is not an e-sim and is not reprogrammable to other carriers. It's set to the Particle MVNO and cannot be changed.

### Buffers

<div align=center><img src="/assets/images/e-series/schematics/e0-buffers-sch.png"></div>

Since u-blox module's communication interface operates at 1.8VDC, while the STM32F205RGT6 microcontroller operates at 3.3VDC, we need voltage translators in-between them. This is achieved with two [SN74AVC4T245](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74avc4t245.pdf) non-inverting buffers. The default state of the USART pins is set with the help of pull-up and pull-down resistors, and the unused input pins are tied to GND.

### 3.3V Regulator and Fuel Gauge

<div align=center><img src="/assets/images/e-series/schematics/e0-reg-sch.png"></div>

The output (3.8V net) of the PMIC is fed directly to the u-blox cellular module and a 3.3VDC high efficiency switching regulator ([TPS62290](http://www.ti.com.cn/cn/lit/ds/symlink/tps62290.pdf)). This 3.3VDC regulator helps power the microcontroller, fuel gauge and the buffers.

The E series employs a [MAX17043](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX17043-MAX17044.pdf) fuel gauge to monitor the LiPo battery voltage and it's state of charge. The microcontroller communicates with it over an I2C interface (same channel as the PMIC).

## Product Handling

### ESD Precautions

<i class="icon-attention"></i> The E series contains highly sensitive electronic circuitry and is an Electrostatic Sensitive Device (ESD). Handling an E series without proper ESD protection may destroy or damage it permanently.  Proper ESD handling and packaging procedures must be applied throughout the processing, handling and operation of any application that incorporates EØs.  ESD precautions should be implemented on the application board where the E series is mounted. Failure to observe these precautions can result in severe damage to the E series! <i class="icon-attention"></i>

### Connectors

There are two connectors on the E series that will get damaged with improper usage.

The micro B USB connector on the E series is soldered on the PCB with large surface pads as well as couple of through hole anchor points. Despite this reinforcement, it is very easy to rip out the connector if too much stress is put on in the vertical direction.

The U.FL antenna connector is not designed to be constantly plugged and unplugged. The antenna pin is static sensitive and you can destroy the radio with improper handling. A tiny dab of glue (epoxy, rubber cement, liquid tape or hot glue) on the connector can be used securely hold the plug in place.

The E series comes pre-programmed with a bootloader and a user application called Tinker. This application works with an iOS and Android app also named Tinker that allows you to very easily toggle digital pins, take analog and digital readings and drive variable PWM outputs.

The bootloader allows you to easily update the user application via several different methods, USB, OTA, Serial Y-Modem, and also internally via the Factory Reset procedure.  All of these methods have multiple tools associated with them as well.

You may use the [Particle Web IDE](https://build.particle.io) to code, compile and flash a user application OTA (Over The Air). [Particle Workbench](/quickstart/workbench/) is a full-featured desktop IDE for Windows, Mac, and Linux based on VSCode and supports both cloud-based and local gcc-arm compiles. The [Particle CLI](/tutorials/developer-tools/cli/) provides a command-line interface for cloud-based compiles and flashing code over USB.

This equipment has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class B digital device, pursuant to Part 15 of the FCC Rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference in a residential installation. This equipment generates, uses and can radiate radio frequency energy and, if not installed and used in accordance with the instructions, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. However, there is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular installation. If this equipment does cause harmful interference to radio or television reception, which can be determined by turning the equipment off and on, the user is encouraged to try to correct the interference by one of the following measures:

- Reorient or relocate the receiving antenna.
- Increase the separation between the equipment and receiver.
- Connect the equipment into an outlet on a circuit different from that to which the receiver is connected.
- Consult the dealer or an experienced radio/TV technician for help.

**FCC Caution:**
Any changes or modifications not expressly approved by the party responsible for compliance could void the user's authority to operate this equipment.
This device complies with Part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation is subject to the following two conditions:

1. This device may not cause harmful interference, and
