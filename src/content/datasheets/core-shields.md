# Shields and accessories

## Shield Shield

This shield is essentially an adapter that allows the user to connect Arduino compatible shields to the Spark Core. There are two functions that this shield performs: pin mapping of the Spark Core to the Arduino pin layout and voltage translation of 3.3V to/from 5V.

### Operation

![Shield Shield](/assets/images/sshield-top.jpg)

We use Texas Instruments [TXB0108PWR](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/txb0108.pdf) to do the voltage translation in between Spark Core's 3.3V logic level and Arduino's 5V logic.

Due to the limited number of pin to function combinations, we have only mapped three analog channels to the Arduino footprint labeled `A0`, `A1` and `A2`. Unlike other IO pins, the analog pins are rated at only a max of 3.3V and NOT 5.0V. **Please remember NOT to exceed this voltage at anytime.**

The shield has an onboard voltage regulator and can be powered from 7V to 15V DC. You could also power it via the USB plug on the Spark Core alone but the current would be limited to 500mA.

### Specifications

![Shield Shield Setup](/assets/images/sshield-setup.jpg)

- Operating voltage: 7 to 15V DC
- Current consumption: without the core plugged in 7mA at 9V DC and 150mA with the Core.
- Dimensions: 3.79" x 2.1"
- Weight: 40g

The pictures shows a robot shield interfaced with the Spark Core via the Shield Shield.

### Pin mapping

```cpp
Arduino | Spark Core | Peripherals
0         RX           Serial1 RX
1         TX           Serial1 TX
2         D2
3         D0           PWM
4         D3
5         D1           PWM

12        A4           PWM,  MISO
13        A3                 SCK
A0        A0           PWM*, ADC**
A1        A1           PWM*, ADC**
A2        A6           PWM*, ADC**

*  Note: These pins can also function as 3.3V
         PWM outputs or 3.3V Servo outputs.

** Note: ADC inputs are 3.3V max.
```

**IMPORTANT**: The Shield Shield does *not* map the Spark Core pins to like-numbered pins on the Arduino. In other words, D0 on the Spark Core is **not** the same as D0 on the Arduino. Please review the pin mapping table to the right and plan accordingly.

## Relay Shield

![Relay Shield Top](/assets/images/relay-shield-top.jpg)

The Relay Shield, in combination with the Spark Core, allows you to control high power devices over the internet. Want to control a lamp, fan or garden sprinklers? Then this is a solution for you!

**IMPORTANT**: This shield provides **regulated power (5v)** to the seated Spark Core and relays. However, it does **not** support power to the devices controlled by the relays.

### Operation

![Relay Shield Setup](/assets/images/relay-shield-setup.jpg)

The schematic for the relay shield is simple and self explanatory. The shield has four relays that are controlled by pins D0, D1, D2 and D3 on the Core. Each relay is triggered via a NPN transistor that takes a control signal from the core and switches the relay coil ON and OFF which in turn makes or breaks the electrical contact on the output. There is also a [flyback diode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyback_diode) connected across the coil to help protect the transistor from high voltage transients caused during switching.

The relays are SPDT (Single Pole Double Throw) type, which means they have three terminals at the output: COMMON (COMM), Normally Open (NO) and Normally Closed (NC). We can either connect the load in between the COMM and NO or COMM and NC terminals. When connected in between COMM and NO, the output remains open/disconnected when the relay is turned OFF and closes/connects when the relay is turned ON. In the later case, the output remains closed/connected when the relay is OFF and opens/disconnects when the relay is ON.

### Specifications

- Operating voltage: 7 to 15V DC
- Current consumption: 150mA min to 290mA (at 9V DC)
- Relay Max Voltage: 250V AC
- Relay Max Current: 10Amp at 125V AC
- Relay Part Number: JS1-5V-F  [(Data Sheet)](http://www3.panasonic.biz/ac/e_download/control/relay/power/catalog/mech_eng_js.pdf?f_cd=300182)
- Dimensions: 3.5 x 3.3
- Weight: 100g


### Setting up the Relay Shield

![Relay Shield Connection](/assets/images/relay-shield-bulb.jpg)

Turning ON a relay is as simple as setting the associated pin to HIGH.

The picture shows a sample setup where the relay is used as a switch to control a light bulb.

```cpp
int RELAY1 = D0;
int RELAY2 = D1;
int RELAY3 = D2;
int RELAY4 = D3;

void setup()
{
   //Initilize the relay control pins as output
   pinMode(RELAY1, OUTPUT);
   pinMode(RELAY2, OUTPUT);
   pinMode(RELAY3, OUTPUT);
   pinMode(RELAY4, OUTPUT);
   // Initialize all relays to an OFF state
   digitalWrite(RELAY1, LOW);
   digitalWrite(RELAY2, LOW);
   digitalWrite(RELAY3, LOW);
   digitalWrite(RELAY4, LOW);

   //register the Spark function
   Spark.function("relay", relayControl);
}

void loop()
{
   // This loops for ever
}

// command format r1,HIGH
int relayControl(String command)
{
  int relayState = 0;
  // parse the relay number
  int relayNumber = command.charAt(1) - '0';
  // do a sanity check
  if (relayNumber < 1 || relayNumber > 4) return -1;

  // find out the state of the relay
  if (command.substring(3,7) == "HIGH") relayState = 1;
  else if (command.substring(3,6) == "LOW") relayState = 0;
  else return -1;

  // write to the appropriate relay
  digitalWrite(relayNumber-1, relayState);
  return 1;
}

```

An example API request to this function would look something like this:

```json
POST /v1/devices/{DEVICE_ID}/relay

# EXAMPLE REQUEST

## Programmer Shield (JTAG)

![JTAG Shield Top](/assets/images/jtag-topview.jpg)

The programmer shield is a simple adapter that lets you connect a JTAG programmer to the Spark Core. If you need complete control over your Core and are comfortable with the ARM development environment, you will need this shield as an interface between the JTAG programmer and the Core.

### Specifications

- Compatible JTAG programmers : STLink  V2 (the only one tested)
- Dimensions: 2.2" x 1.55"
- Weight: 20g

### Setting up the programmer

![JTAG Setup](/assets/images/jtag-setup.jpg)

If you are using the STLink V2, you can download the supporting drivers and utilities from [their website.](http://www.st.com/web/catalog/tools/FM146/CL1984/SC724/SS1677/PF251168)

All of the hardware files for the JTAG shield are available for download.

## Battery Shield

![Battery Shield Top](/assets/images/bshield-top.jpg)

The battery shield is a LiPo battery charger and voltage regulator combined into one. You can use it to power your Core with any 3.7V LiPo battery and charge it at the same time via the USB port.
The shield is built around  Microchip's MCP73871 battery charge management controller and TI's TPS61200 boost converter for up converting 3.7V to 5.0V.

![Battery Shield Bottom](/assets/images/bshield-bottom.jpg)


<!--TO DO ADD SYSTEM BLOCK DIAGRAM HERE -->

### Operation

MCP73871 is an intelligent battery charge management controller that allows one to charge the battery and power the system simultaneously. There is also an under voltage lock out which protects the battery from draining completely. The TPS61200 converts the 3.7V to 4.1V battery output to a regulated 5V to power the Core or potentially any other hardware (cellphones?!)
The charge current to the battery is set to 500mA.

<!--Link to GitHub repo.-->

### Specifications

- Works with any 3.7V Lithium Polymer battery.
- Simultaneously charge the battery and power the core
- Dimensions: 2.3 x 0.61
- Weight: 20g
- Datasheet: [MCP73871](https://github.com/spark/shields/blob/master/core-shields/Battery%20Shield/battery-shield-smallinductor/Datasheets/MCP73871.pdf) and [TPS61200](https://github.com/spark/shields/blob/master/core-shields/Battery%20Shield/battery-shield-smallinductor/Datasheets/tps61200.pdf)


### Setting up the shield

![Battery Shield Charging](/assets/images/bshield-charging.jpg)

In order to just charge the battery, simply plug the battery into the JST connector (**CAUTION: Remember to check the polarity of the battery header!!**) and a USB cable into the microB socket as shown in the picture.

You will see the BLUE power LED light up on the shield and either the YELLOW (indicating charging in progress) or GREEN (indicating charging complete) LED light up.

![Battery Shield Charging and Powering](/assets/images/bshield-charging-powering.jpg)

To summarize the LED functions:

- Blue LED: Power indicator for the USB cable. Lights up only when the USB cable is plugged in.
- Yellow LED: Charging in progress indicator. Is ON when the battery is charging. Turns OFF when charging complete.
- Green LED: Charge Complete Indicator. This LED lights up when the battery is completely charged.

You could also power the Spark Core while the battery is charging but remember that the charging might be slower as the current will be distributed in between the Core and the battery.

![Battery Shield Powering](/assets/images/bshield-powering.jpg)

When powering the Core via the battery alone, the blue LED will NOT light up.

**TIP:** Remember to unplug the battery from the shield when not in use. If you leave the battery connected to the battery shield, it will eventually drain it.
