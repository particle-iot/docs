### Power
The Tracker SoM can be powered via the VIN (3.9V-17VDC) pin, over USB, or a LiPo battery. 

#### VIN
The input voltage range on VIN pin is 3.9VDC to 17VDC. When powering from the VIN pin alone, make sure that the power supply is rated at 10W (for example 5 VDC at 2 Amp). If the power source is unable to meet this requirement, you'll need connect the LiPo battery as well.  An additional bulk capacitance of 470uF to 1000uF should be added to the VIN input when the LiPo Battery is disconnected.  The amount of capacitance required will depend on the ability of the power supply to deliver peak currents to the cellular modem.

#### LiPo
This pin serves two purposes. You can use this pin to connect a LiPo battery (either directly or using a JST connector), or it can be used to connect an external DC power source (and this is where one needs to take extra precautions). When powering it from an external regulated DC source, the  recommended input voltage range on this pin is between 3.6V to 4.4VDC. Make sure that the supply can handle currents of at least 3Amp. This is the most efficient way of powering the module since the PMIC bypasses the regulator and supplies power to the module via an internal FET leading to lower quiescent current.

When powered from a LiPo battery alone, the power management IC switches off the internal regulator and supplies power to the system directly from the battery. This reduces the conduction losses and maximizes battery run time. The battery provided with the module is a Lithium-Ion Polymer battery rated at 3.7VDC 1,800mAh. You can substitute this battery with another 3.7V LiPo with higher current rating. Remember to never exceed this voltage rating and always pay attention to the polarity of the connector. A LiPo battery with internal protection circuits is recommended.

Typical current consumption is around 180mA and up to 1.8A transients at 5VDC. In deep sleep mode, the quiescent current is 130uA [this value may change] (powered from the battery alone).

The MAX17043 fuel gauge is only compatible with single cell lithium-ion batteries. The state-of-charge (SoC) values will not be accurate with other battery chemistries.

#### VBUS

VBUS is connected to the USB detect pin of nRF52840 to enables the USB interface. The recommended input voltage range is between 4.35V to 5.5V DC. It is also connected to the bq24195 PMIC to allow for DPDM, detection of the power capacity of the USB port.

#### 3V3 Pin
This pin is the output of the on-board 3.3V switching regulator that powers the microcontroller and the peripherals. This pin can be used as a 3.3V power source with a max load of 800mA. Unlike the Photon, this pin _CANNOT_ be used as an input to power the module.


#### RTC_BAT
This is the supply to the real-time clock battery backup. 1.4 to 3.6V. 

| Voltage | Typical Current | Maximum Current | Unit |
| :---:   | ---:            | ---:            | :--- |
| 3.0V    | 56              | 330             | nA   |
| 1.8V    | 52              | 290             | nA   |

If the RTC battery is not used, connect RTC_BAT to ground.

#### GNSS_BAT
This is the supply for maintaining the u-blox GNSS ephemeris and almanac data when removing power. This can use the same battery as RTC_BAT, can be a super-capacitor, or can be omitted. 1.5 to 3.6V. Typical current is 15 uA.

If you are not powering GNSS\_BAT with a battery or super-capacitor, connect GNSS\_BAT to 3V3.

- Saving the ephemeris and almanac data can improve fix/lock time.
- It won't make a difference on completely cold boot, where is no previously saved data.
- It does not make a difference if the GNSS is constantly powered or is using a software power save mode.

---

#### PMID
This pin is the output of the internal boost regulator of the PMIC that can source 5.1VDC from the battery in OTG (On The Go) mode. This feature is useful when your circuitry needs a 5V source from the module when powered by the battery alone.

The confusing bit about this pin is that it will continue to provide 5.1VDC but only when the input voltage (VIN) is between 3.6V to 5.1VDC. As soon as the input voltage exceeds this limit, the PMID starts tracking _that_ voltage. For example if VIN = 9VDC, the PMID will be 9VDC and _NOT_ 5.1VDC. So you need to be careful when using it as a source for powering your external circuitry. The max current draw on this pin is 2.1A but is not recommended due to thermal limitations of the circuit board.

### Antennas

There are a number of U.FL antenna connectors on the Tracker SoM:

| Label | Purpose | 
| :---: | :--- |
| GNSS | u-blox GNSS antenna (GPS) |
| CELL | Quectel cellular modem antenna |
| WIFI | Wi-Fi antenna for Wi-Fi geolocation (optional)<sup>1</sup> |
| BLE  | External Bluetooth (optional)<sup>2</sup> |
| GNSS/DIV | Quectel GNSS antenna (optional)<sup>1</sup> |
| DIV  | LTE cellular receive diversity antenna<sup>3</sup>  |


<sup>1</sup>Not supported in initial release.

<sup>2</sup>There is a BLE chip antenna on the module, the external BLE antenna is optional.

<sup>3</sup>DIV is the connector for the LTE cellular receive diversity antenna (T523 only). A second cellular antenna can be connected to this connector to improve performance when the device will be moving at high speeds. It is only used for LTE Cat 1 connections and is not supported when in 2G or 3G mode. This antenna is not necessary in most cases and is not included in evaluation kits. The T402 does not have this connector as receive diversity is not supported in LTE Cat M1 mode.

There is no U.FL connector for NFC. If you wish to use the NFC tag feature, you'll need to add an antenna or antenna connector on your base board.

- The antenna placement needs to follow some basic rules, as any antenna is sensitive to its environment. Mount the antenna at least 10mm from metal components or surfaces, ideally 20mm for best radiation efficiency, and try to maintain a minimum of three directions free from obstructions to be able to operate effectively.
- Needs tuning with actual product enclosure and all components.
- For the BLE antenna, it is recommended to use a 2.4 GHz single-frequency antenna and not a 2.4 GHz + 5 GHz antenna, so as to avoid large gain at the frequency twice of 2.4 GHz which can cause the second harmonic radiation of 2.4 GHz to exceed standards.

#### GNSS Antenna

As the GNSS system is receive-only (no transmitter), you can use any GNSS compatible antenna without affecting the certification. Different GNSS systems use different frequencies. Many antennas are tuned to the United States GPS system, however you can also get multi-GNSS antennas that are compatible with other systems. All of these systems offer coverage world-wide.

### Status LED

The Tracker SoM does not have an on-module RGB system status LED. We have provided its individual control pins for you to connect an LED of 
your liking. This will allow greater flexibility in the end design of your products.

Device OS assumes a common anode RGB LED. One common LED that meets the requirements is the 
[Cree CLMVC-FKA-CL1D1L71BB7C3C3](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/cree-inc/CLMVC-FKA-CL1D1L71BB7C3C3/CLMVC-FKA-CL1D1L71BB7C3C3CT-ND/) 
which is inexpensive and easily procured. You need to add three current limiting resistors. With this LED, we typically use 1K ohm current limiting resistors. 
These are much larger than necessary. They make the LED less blinding but still provide sufficient current to light the LEDs. 
If you want maximum brightness you should use the calculated values - 33 ohm on red, and 66 ohm on green and blue.

A detailed explanation of different color codes of the RGB system LED can be found [here](/tutorials/device-os/led/).

## Product Handling

### ESD Precautions
The Tracker SoM contains highly sensitive electronic circuitry and is an Electrostatic Sensitive Device (ESD). Handling an module without proper ESD protection may destroy or damage it permanently. Proper ESD handling and packaging procedures must be applied throughout the processing, handling and operation of any application that incorporates the module. ESD precautions should be implemented on the application board where the B series is mounted. Failure to observe these precautions can result in severe damage to the module!

### Connectors

The U.FL antenna connectors are not designed to be constantly plugged and unplugged. The antenna pin is static sensitive and you can destroy the radio with improper handling. A tiny dab of glue (epoxy, rubber cement, liquid tape or hot glue) on the connector can be used securely hold the plug in place.

### Disposal

![WEEE](/assets/images/weee.png)

This device must be treated as Waste Electrical & Electronic Equipment (WEEE) when disposed of.

Any WEEE marked waste products must not be mixed with general household waste, but kept separate for the treatment, recovery and recycling of the materials used. For proper treatment, recovery and recycling; please take all WEEE marked waste to your Local Authority Civic waste site, where it will be accepted free of charge. If all consumers dispose of Waste Electrical & Electronic Equipment correctly, they will be helping to save valuable resources and preventing any potential negative effects upon human health and the environment of any hazardous materials that the waste may contain.


## Default settings

The AssetTracker SoM comes pre-programmed with a bootloader and a user application called Tinker. This application works with an iOS and Android app also named Tinker that allows you to very easily toggle digital pins, take analog and digital readings and drive variable PWM outputs.

The bootloader allows you to easily update the user application via several different methods, USB, OTA, Serial Y-Modem, and also internally via the Factory Reset procedure. All of these methods have multiple tools associated with them as well.
