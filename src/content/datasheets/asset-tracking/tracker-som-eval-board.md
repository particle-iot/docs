### Powering the Tracker SoM Evaluation Board

There are several options for powering the evaluation board:

The **MCU USB** connector. If using a laptop with a 500 mA USB port, you should also use the LiPo battery. With a 2A tablet charger, you can power only by USB.

The **VIN** connector (3.9 to 17 VDC). This is useful with an external power supply. Switch **S6** is the power switch.

The **LiPo** connector. This is typically used with a LiPo battery. Use switch **S4** to enable the battery.

### USB connectors

There are three USB connectors on the evaluation board, however you most commonly will only use the **MCU USB** connector.

The **MCU USB** connector is connected to the nRF52 MCU and can be used for Serial debugging, flashing code, and setup by USB. It can also power the AssetTracker SoM. If using a laptop with a 500 mA USB port, you should also use the LiPo battery. With a 2A tablet charger, you can power only by USB.

The **GNSS USB** connector is connected to the u-blox NEO-M8U GNSS. It can be used for firmware upgrades or with the u-blox u-center application.

The **CELL USB** connector is connected to the Quectel cellular modem. It can be used for firmware upgrades.

### LED Indicators

The **STAT** LED indicates the charge status:

- Off: Not charging or no power
- On: Charging
- Blinking: Charge fault
- Flickering: No battery

Jumper **J9** disconnects the charge status LED.

The **3V3** LED indicates that the 3.3V MCU power supply is enabled. Jumper **J8** disconnects the power LED.

### CAN Connector

The four-position screw terminal connector (J4) allows connection to CAN bus devices.

| Pin   | Label   | Description |
| :---: | :-----: | :--- |
| 1     | CAN_H   | CAN Bus H or + |
| 2     | CAN_L   | CAN Bus L or - |
| 3     | GND     | Ground |
| 4     | CAN_VCC | 3.3V or 5V |

The CAN bus connection includes the 120 ohm termination resistor and ESD protection.

The CAN_VCC jumper (J5) allows the selection of the voltage on the CAN connector.

- Left position: 3.3V
- Right position: 5V

The 5V power supply is powered by a boost converter and can be turned on and off by software.

## Basic Setup

The basic setup for the Tracker SoM Eval Board to be operational is shown below:

- Plug the cellular antenna into the U.FL connector labeled **CELL** on the SoM. Remember never to power up this board without the antenna being connected. There is potential to damage the transmitter of the cellular module if no antenna is connected.
- Connect power the **MCU USB** (8), **VIN** (13), or a LiPo battery (14).
- Turn on the appropriate power switches (15 and/or 16).

## Product Handling

### ESD Precautions
The Tracker SoM contains highly sensitive electronic circuitry and is an Electrostatic Sensitive Device (ESD). Handling an module without proper ESD protection may destroy or damage it permanently. Proper ESD handling and packaging procedures must be applied throughout the processing, handling and operation of any application that incorporates the module. ESD precautions should be implemented on the application board where the B series is mounted. Failure to observe these precautions can result in severe damage to the module!

### Connectors

The U.FL antenna connectors are not designed to be constantly plugged and unplugged. The antenna pin is static sensitive and you can destroy the radio with improper handling. A tiny dab of glue (epoxy, rubber cement, liquid tape or hot glue) on the connector can be used securely hold the plug in place.
