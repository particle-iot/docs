# Shields and accessories

## Shield Shield

Sometimes life can be a little difficult in the land of electronics when two systems talk a different voltage language. How do you make them talk to each other without making one of them _burn out_? The Shield Shield is the answer. This shield performs all the necessary voltage translation and provides an Arduino-compatible footprint to make it easier for you to plug in your existing Arduino shields or talk to other 5V hardware.

![Shield Shield](/assets/images/shields/shield-shield/shield-shield.png)

### Shield Shield - Operation

We use Texas Instruments TXB0108PWR to do the voltage translation in between the Particle's device's 3.3V to a 5V logic. Unlike other IO pins, the analog pins are rated at only a max of 3.3V and **NOT** 5.0V. Please remember NOT to exceed this voltage at anytime. The shield has an on-board voltage regulator and can be powered from 7V to 15V DC source. You could also power it via the USB plug on the Particle device alone but the current would be limited to 500mA.

### Shield Shield Schematic - TXB0108PWR

![Shield Shield TXB0108PWR](/assets/images/shields/shield-shield/txb0108pwr-schematic.png)

The new version of the Shield Shield (v3.x.x) uses dedicated MOSFET based voltage translation on the I2C lines. We also decided to add a prototyping area in empty space in the middle of the shield.

![Shield Shield Description](/assets/images/shields/shield-shield/shield-shield-description.png)

**Note:** One drawback of using the TXB0108PWR as a voltage translator is that it is only capable of driving loads at short distances. Long length wires will introduce excessive capacitive loading and cause the auto direction detection to fail. To overcome this drawback, the shield shield also has an optional on-board 74ABT125 buffer that is capable of driving heavier loads in *one* direction. A user can jumper wire to whichever IO pin they would like to be translated to 5V.

### Shield Shield - Pin Mapping

|A4      | D0     |     SDA,PWM*            |
|A5      | D1     |     SCL,PWM*,CAN_TX     |

\* Note: These pins can also function as 3.3V PWM outputs or 3.3V Servo outputs.  
\*\* Note: ADC inputs are 3.3V max.

**IMPORTANT:** The Shield Shield does not map the Particle device's pins to like-numbered pins on the Arduino. In other words, D0 on the Particle device is not the same as D0 on the Arduino. Please review the pin mapping table to the right and plan accordingly.

## Relay Shield
The Relay Shield allows you to take over the world, one electric appliance at a time. Want to control a lamp, fan, coffee machine, aquarium pumps or garden sprinklers? Then this is a solution for you!

The shield comes with four relays that are rated at a max of 220V @10Amp allowing you to control any electric appliance rated at under 2000 Watts. You are not just limited to an appliance though; any gadget that requires high voltage and/or a lot of current can be controlled with this shield.

![Relay Shield](/assets/images/shields/relay-shield/relayshield.png)

We have even provided a small prototyping area around the shield for you to add more components or connectors. A temperature sensor to go along with your brewer, maybe?

**IMPORTANT:** This shield provides regulated power (5V) to the seated Particle device and relays. However, it does not support power to the devices controlled by the relays.

### Relay Shield - Library
If you're already logged into Build.particle.io then you can [jump directly to the library](https://build.particle.io/libs/RelayShield/0.0.6/tab/1_Blink_a_Relay.cpp) to get going quickly and easily with the RelayShield library, which wraps all the features in easy-to-use functions.

Examples include:
1. __Blink a Relay__ - How to turn a relay on and off
2. __Blink all the Relays__ - An extension on the simplest case
3. __Internet Relays__ - Creating Particle.function()s so that you can turn relays on and off over the Internet

### Relay Shield - Operation

The schematic for the relay shield is simple and self explanatory. The shield has four relays that are controlled by pins D3, D4, D5 and D6 on the Particle device. Each relay is triggered via a NPN transistor that takes a control signal from the Particle device and switches the relay coil ON and OFF, which in turn makes or breaks the electrical contact on the output. There is also a fly-back diode connected across the coil to help protect the transistor from high voltage transients caused during switching.

**NOTE:** On the under side of the relay shield (top center), you will see 4 solder pads that are by default bridged via traces. You can scratch off the trace to disconnect the control pin from the preassigned ones (D3 to D6) and wire up based on your project requirement.

### Relay Shield Schematic - Control

![Relay Shield Interface](/assets/images/shields/relay-shield/relay-shield-schematic-1.png)

The relays are SPDT (Single Pole Double Throw) type, which means they have three terminals at the output: COMMON (COMM), Normally Open (NO) and Normally Closed (NC). We can either connect the load in between the COMM and NO or COMM and NC terminals. When connected in between COMM and NO, the output remains open/disconnected when the relay is turned OFF and closes/connects when the relay is turned ON. In the later case, the output remains closed/connected when the relay is OFF and opens/disconnects when the relay is ON.

### Relay Shield Schematic - Power Supply

![Relay Shield Power Supply](/assets/images/shields/relay-shield/relay-shield-schematic-2.png)

The Relay Shield uses a high efficiency [RT8259](http://www.richtek.com/download_ds.jsp?p=RT8259) switch mode voltage regulator that provides a constant 5V to the Particle device and the relays. The regulator is rated at 1.2A max output current which is ample enough to power the Particle device, the four relays and still have left over for other things you may decided to connect later. You can power the shield via the 5.5mm barrel jack or through the screw terminal. There is a reverse polarity protection diode in place so that you don't fry the electronics by plugging in the wires in reverse!

Here is an example setup to control a light bulb. The relay acts like a switch which is normally open and when pin D3 on the Particle device is turned HIGH, it activates Relay 1 thereby closing the circuit on the light bulb and turning it ON. Ta dah!

### Relay Shield - Sample Setup

![Relay Shield Setup](/assets/images/shields/relay-shield/relay-shield-setup.png)

### Relay Shield - Sample Code

```cpp
int RELAY1 = D3;
int RELAY2 = D4;
int RELAY3 = D5;
int RELAY4 = D6;

void setup()
{
   //Initilize the relay control pins as output
   pinMode(RELAY1, OUTPUT);
   pinMode(RELAY2, OUTPUT);
   pinMode(RELAY3, OUTPUT);
   pinMode(RELAY4, OUTPUT);
   // Initialize all relays to an OFF state
   digitalWrite(RELAY1, LOW);
   digitalWrite(RELAY2, LOW);
   digitalWrite(RELAY3, LOW);
   digitalWrite(RELAY4, LOW);

   //register the Particle function
   Particle.function("relay", relayControl);
}

void loop()
{
   // This loops for ever
}

// command format r1,HIGH
int relayControl(String command)
{
  int relayState = 0;
  // parse the relay number
  int relayNumber = command.charAt(1) - '0';
  // do a sanity check
  if (relayNumber < 1 || relayNumber > 4) return -1;

  // find out the state of the relay
  if (command.substring(3,7) == "HIGH") relayState = 1;
  else if (command.substring(3,6) == "LOW") relayState = 0;
  else return -1;

  // write to the appropriate relay
  digitalWrite(relayNumber+2, relayState);
  return 1;
}

```

**Changing the relay control pins: (Advanced)**
Not happy with which pins control the relays? Worry not. With a little bit of scratching and soldering, you can reconfigure the control pins.

Here is how to perform that surgery:
 - Tools needed:
    - Hobby knife
    - Soldering Iron
    - Wires
    - Multimeter (optional)
    - Steady pair of hands (not optional)
 - Steps:
    - Scratch the tracks in between the pads
    - Test it with a multimeter for continuity
    - Solder wire to the chosen pin
    - Done!

[pictures of the steps]

 Not happy with the change you just made? You can always go back to the default configuration by desoldering your new wired connection and adding a solder-jumper on the scratched pads.

## Programmer Shield

Do you want to gain complete control over your Particle device right down to its every bit of memory space? or watch as your code gets executed and debug it? Then this shield should be able to pacify that control freak inside of you.

![Programmer Shield](/assets/images/shields/prog-shield/prog-shield.png)

This is a FT2232H based JTAG programmer shield that is compatible with OpenOCD and Broadcom's WICED IDE. The FT2232 chip is setup to provide an USB-JTAG and USB-UART interface simultaneously. The FT2232 can be also reconfigured by the user by reprogramming the on-board config EEPROM. The unused pins are clearly marked and broken out into easy to access header holes.

The USB-UART interface is connected to the TX and RX of a Particle device and communicates via [Serial1](/reference/firmware#serial)

![Programmer Shield Description](/assets/images/shields/prog-shield/prog-shield-description.png)

For more instructions on setting up OpenOCD and using the Programmer Shield, please read through the README at the landing page of the Programmer Shield repository on GitHub, linked below:

![Programmer Shield Dimensions](/assets/images/shields/prog-shield/prog-shield-dimensions.png)

## Power Shield

The Power Shield, as the name implies, allows the Particle device to be powered from different types of power sources. The shield has an intelligent battery charger and power management unit along with a wide input voltage regulator and an I2C based fuel-gauge. You can power a Particle device with either a USB plug or a DC supply of anywhere from 7 to 20VDC and charge a [3.7V LiPo battery](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8483) all at the same time.

![Power Shield](/assets/images/shields/power-shield/power-shield.png)

The system switches in between the different power sources automatically, reducing the charge and discharge cycle stress on the battery. The fuel gauge allows you to monitor the battery's state-of-charge (SOC), allowing it to notify the user remotely and take preemptive actions when necessary.

![Power Shield Plugged](/assets/images/shields/power-shield/power-shield-photon-plugged.png)

The shield is setup so that when powered from the USB port as well as from a DC supply, it chooses the DC source over USB. The charge current is set to 500mA when charging from USB and set to 1A when charging from a DC source.

![Power Shield Supply](/assets/images/shields/power-shield/power-shield-powersupply.png)

There are two status LEDs located on the left of the JST battery connector labeled `STAT1` and `STAT2`. Here is a table of the LED behavior depending on which state the battery charger is in:

|STAT1 (Blue)  | STAT2 (Red) | Charge State |
|--------|--------|-------------------------|
|ON      | ON     | Precharge in progress   |
|ON      | OFF    | Fast charge in progress |
|OFF     | ON     | Charge done             |
|OFF     | OFF    | Charge suspend (temperature), timer fault, and sleep mode |


### Power Shield - Specifications
 - Operating voltage: USB or External DC of 7 to 20V
 - Current consumption: 500mA max (USB) & 1.2A max (other DC sources)
 - Dimensions: 1" x 1.84"

 <!-- - Weight: -->

 ![Power Shield Dimensions](/assets/images/shields/power-shield/power-shield-dimensions.png)

**NOTE:** There is a know issue on the v2.1.0 of the Power Shield where the shield will fail to power up the Photon when the battery is inserted for the first time or reinserted after a long time (>60mins). The user will need to unplug and plug the battery back again for the shield to power up. The issue arises by the fact that on startup, the battery charger confuses the Photon booting up to there being a short circuit and powers off to save the device. If you are feeling adventurous, you can fix this issue by soldering a 10nF capacitor across the DPPM pin and GND. This delays the short-circuit protection at startup and lets the Photon bootup without any issues.

## Internet Button

The Internet Button is not only an easy way to get started on the Internet of Things, it's also a clean and simple way to start building your own prototypes. Quickly start playing with LEDs, multiple buttons, an accelerometer and more without any wires or soldering.

**NOTE:** There is a silkscreen issue with the current release of the Internet Button. On the PCB, the silkscreen labels are incorrect. The correct mapping is, from **right** to **left**, "1-2-3-4", *not* "4-3-2-1" as annotated on the PCB. For super double extra clarity, please see the following pin mapping label table:</span>

|Photon Pin | Correct Mapping | Incorrect Mapping |
|--------|--------|-------------------------|
|D4 | Button 1   | Button 4 |
|D5 | Button 2   | Button 3 |
|D6 | Button 3   | Button 2 |
|D7 | Button 4   | Button 1 |

## Electron Solar Kit
The Solar Kit comes with everything you need to make a solar powered cellular project! Super efficient power design so you can go off-the-grid with no need of wires. It has a big 6W solar panel, waterproof enclosure with cable gland for connecting the panel, and a super low-power timing circuit so the Electron can sleep in between readings. It's an ideal solution for field sensing that needs to go on for months or years.

### Using the Solar Kit
Assembly:
1. Screw the cable gland into the side of the box. If you want it to be truly water-tight, you should add some silicone caulk. Also, the inner nut may not have enough clearance to fit, but that's fine with caulking.
2. Screw the Solar Shield down inside the box using the included M4 screws.
3. Pass the barrel jack wire through the cable gland, leaving the bare wires inside the box and the connector outside.
4. Put the red wire into the terminal block marked "+" and the black wire into "GND" and tighten them down firmly with a small screwdriver.
5. Tighten the cable gland around the barrel jack wire,
6. Plug the Electron into the shield with the USB pointing inward
7. Connect the male JST wire from the shield to the female JST on the Electron
8. Plug the battery into the Solar Shield's female JST
9. Connect the solar panel to the barrel jack. This may take a little force to get secure.

*Note: The lid has small plastic "keys" that will only allow it to be screwed down securely in one orientation. Look for them at the outer corners right next to the screw holes*

## Electron Asset Tracker

![Asset Tracker with Electron](/assets/images/shields/asset-tracker-shield/asset-tracker-v002-electron.png)

The Asset Tracker is a cellular solution for tracking the location of just about anything! The included shield has a GPS module and an accelerometer, so you can make projects that use location, orientation, and movement. Report vibration as you drive around, save power by keeping the cell modem and GPS off if the device isn't moving, or track boxes. Also has a screw terminal for adding another power source and a connector for adding an external GPS antenna if it's going to be inside something. Designed by Adafruit!

### Using the Asset Tracker

![Asset Tracker Description](/assets/images/shields/asset-tracker-shield/asset-tracker-v002-descriptions.png)

**Power**

There are a couple of different ways that you can power this shield. You can power it via the screw terminal from a 5V to 12V DC supply (make sure it can support at least 2 Amp current peaks) or you can simply power it via the LiPo battery that came with the Electron. You can also use the two sources together. We do not recommend powering it from a USB source, as the USB cable will block the GPS module leading to a poor or no satellite reception. If you HAVE to use the USB power, then make sure to use an external GPS antenna.

Say if you want to put the asset tracker inside a car, you can use the car's battery as the main power source and use the LiPo battery as a backup when the car is turned off. Remember that in order for the battery to last a long time, it's ideal that you put the Electron in deep sleep mode and turn off the GPS when not needed. This is described in greater detail under the library section.

![Asset Tracker Emotions](/assets/images/shields/asset-tracker-shield/asset-emotions.gif)

Your asset tracker has emotions too. Don't make it sad. Don't be that guy.

**GPS**

The shield has the same GPS module as the [Adafruit Ultimate GPS](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ultimate-gps/) so all of their specs and usage notes apply here, too. It's the PA6H module based around the Mediatek's MT3339 GPS receiver.  

The primary bit to know is that the GPS module can take _several minutes_ to get a lock, and may not get a lock at all if it doesn't have a *clear view* of the sky- sorry, no indoors projects. If this is proving a problem for you, an [external antenna](https://www.adafruit.com/products/960) may help (don't forget an SMA to uFL adapter!).

When the `GPS Fix` LED is blinking once per second (1Hz) then it is trying to get a fix but does not yet have one. It will **turn OFF** when it actively has a fix, and you can check that from code using the `.gpsFix()` function.

![Asset Tracker Fix](/assets/images/shields/asset-tracker-shield/asset-fix-animation.gif)

The GPS is connected to the Serial1 UART on the Electron, and we've also provided a MOSFET to completely shut off power to it for major power savings. Pin D6 controls the GPS power, with inverted logic. This means that the GPS will only be ON when D6 is LOW, which should keep it off even if you put the Electron to sleep.

**Backup battery**

There's a backup battery holder for the GPS to reduce subsequent fix acquisition times, but it's *not required*. This is the small coin cell (part number CR1220) holder slot. Inserting the coin cell powers up the internal RTC of the GPS module and also help retain the satellite data in its volatile RAM. It is highly recommended that you have this battery plugged in at all times to bring down fix times.

**Accelerometer**

The shield also has an on-board accelerometer, the <a href="http://www2.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/datasheet/3c/ae/50/85/d6/b1/46/fe/CD00274221.pdf/files/CD00274221.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.CD00274221.pdf" target="_blank">LIS3DH</a>. It's extremely low power so won't chew up your energy budget. The accel communicates over SPI, so it takes up A2, A3, A4, and A5 as marked on the silkscreen of the shield. A configurable interrupt from the LIS3DH is connected to the Electron's "wake" (WKP) pin, so you should be able to make a project where the Electron and GPS stay in deep sleep until it's hit hard enough to cross a threshold you set on the accelerometer.

**Enclosure**

The waterproof box includes two M4 screws for mounting the shield securely into the box. Screw the shield down in the enclosure, then plug the Electron into the shield with the USB connector facing inward. You can also look at the silkscreen Electron outline on the board for the correct orientation. The battery and antenna can be fixed in the box using the foam adhesive tape if you want to keep them from moving around.

### Asset tracker library

## Electron Asset Tracker v2

![atv2](/assets/images/shields/asset-tracker-shield-v2/asset.png)

This new revision of the Electron Asset Tracker uses a uBlox M8 engine GNSS receiver. Unlike the v1, this module is capable of receiving 3 GNSS (GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, BeiDou) concurrently. We have also added a low noise amplifier and a band pass filter for improved performance with the on-board antenna.

### Using the Asset Tracker

![atv2](/assets/images/shields/asset-tracker-shield-v2/asset-description.png)

**Power**

There are a couple of different ways that you can power this shield. You can power it via the screw terminal from a 5V to 12V DC supply (make sure it can support at least 2 Amp current peaks) or you can simply power it via the LiPo battery that came with the Electron.

This is described in greater detail under the library section.

![atv2](/assets/images/shields/asset-tracker-shield-v2/asset-power.png)

**GPS**

The GPS is connected to the Serial1 UART on the Electron, and we've also provided a MOSFET to completely shut off power to it for major power savings. Pin D6 controls the GPS power, with inverted logic. This means that the GPS will only be ON when D6 is LOW, which should keep it off even if you put the Electron to sleep.

When the module acquires a satellite fix, the **SAT FIX** LED on the shield will start blinking at the rate of once per second. The acquisition time can vary anywhere from 26 seconds, from a cold start, to around 1 second from a hot restart.

**Backup Power** 

The shield has a super capacitor connected to the back up power of the GPS receiver. This helps the receiver retain time and satellite fix information upon a power cycle. The capacitor should be able to provide backup power for a few minutes after you remove the main supply. This is helpful when you are changing batteries or plugging/unplugging the Electron. For longer backup times, we have provided a footprint to solder in a CR2032 coin sell holder at the bottom. In most cases, you will not need it.

**Accelerometer**

The shield also has an on-board accelerometer, the <a href="http://www2.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/datasheet/3c/ae/50/85/d6/b1/46/fe/CD00274221.pdf/files/CD00274221.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.CD00274221.pdf" target="_blank">LIS3DH</a>.

A configurable interrupt from the LIS3DH is connected to the Electron's "wake" (WKP) pin, so you should be able to make a project where the Electron and GPS stay in deep sleep until it's hit hard enough to cross a threshold you set on the accelerometer.

**Grove Sensor Ports**

We have provided two grove sensor ports for you to easily connect sensors to the asset tracker. One of the connector exposes the I2C port (D0 and D1), while the other exposes two analog pins (A0 and A1).

![atv2](/assets/images/shields/asset-tracker-shield-v2/asset-ports.png)

**Enclosure**

You can choose to mount the asset tracker board inside the provided enclosure as shown below. Use the four M3 screws to secure the board in place. The antenna comes with a peel-able sticky back that can be used to stick the antenna to the side wall. Remember not to block the GPS antenna with anything - wires, antenna, battery, etc.
