<div align=center> <a href="/assets/images/argon/argon-block-diagram.png" target="_blank"> <img src="/assets/images/argon/argon-block-diagram.png" ></a></div>

### Power

#### USB PORT
The USB port is the easiest way to power up the Argon. Please make sure that the USB port is able to provide at least 500mA. Power from the USB is regulated down to 3.3V by the on board Torex XC9258A step-down regulator. 

#### VUSB PIN
The pin is internally connected to the VBUS of the USB port. The nominal output should be around 4.5 to 5 VDC when the device is plugged into the USB port and 0 when not connected to a USB source. You can use this pin to power peripherals that operate at such voltages. Do not exceed the current rating of the USB port, which is nominally rated to 500mA.  This pin is also protected with an internal fuse rated at 1000mA.

#### LiPo
If you want to make your projects truly wireless, you can power the device with a single cell LiPo (3.7V). The Argon has an on board LiPo charger that will charge and power the device when USB source is plugged in or power the device from the LiPo alone in the absence of the USB.

{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed warningBox"}}
**NOTE:**
Please pay attention to the polarity of the LiPo connector. Not all LiPo batteries follow the same polarity convention!
{{box op="end"}}

<div align=center><img src="/assets/images/lipo-polarity.png" ></div>

#### Li+ PIN
This pin is internally connected to the positive terminal of the LiPo connector. You can connect a single cell LiPo/Lithium Ion or a DC supply source to this pin for powering the Argon. Remember that the input voltage range on this pin is 3.6 to 4.2 VDC. 

#### 3V3 PIN
This pin is the output of the on board 3.3V step-down switching regulator (Torex XC9258A). The regulator is rated at 1000mA max. When using this pin to power other devices or peripherals remember to budget in the current requirement of the Argon first. This pin can also be used to power the Argon in absence of the USB or LiPo power. When powering over this pin, please connect the ENABLE pin to GND so that the on board regulator is disabled.

#### EN PIN

The **EN** pin is not a power pin, per se, but it controls the 3V3 power. The EN pin is pulled high by a 100K resistor to the higher of VUSB, the micro USB connector, or Li+. Because the pull-up can result in voltages near 5V you should never directly connect EN to a 3.3V GPIO pin. Instead, you should only pull EN low, such as by using an N-channel MOSFET or other open-collector transistor.

The EN pin can force the device into a deep power-down state where it uses very little power. It also can used to assure that the device is completely reset, similar to unplugging it, with one caveat:

If using the EN pin to deeply reset the device, you must be careful not to allow leakage current back into the nRF52 MCU by GPIO or by pull-ups to 3V3. If you only power external devices by 3V3 you won't run into this, as 3V3 is de-powered when EN is low. 

However, if you have circuitry that is powered by a separate, external power supply, you must be careful. An externally powered circuit that drives a nRF52 GPIO high when EN is low can provide enough current to keep the nRF52 from powering down and resetting. Likewise, a pull-up to an external power supply can do the same thing. Be sure that in no circumstances can power by supplied to the nRF52 when 3V3 is de-powered.

[See the power supply schematic](#power-1), below, for more information.

### Antenna

There are two radios on the Argon. A BLE radio (nRF52840) and a WiFi radio (ESP32). For the WiFi radio, we have provided a u.FL connector to plug in the WiFi antenna. This is required if you wish to use the WiFi connectivity. 

There are two options for the BLE antenna on the Argon. It comes with an on-board PCB antenna which is selected by default in the device OS and a u.FL connector if you wish to connect an external antenna. If you wish to use the external antenna, you'll need to issue an appropriate command in the firmware.

### FCC approved antennas

**BLE and WiFi**

The Argon includes one of these antennas, but a second for use with BLE can be purchased in the [Particle online store](https://store.particle.io/products/wi-fi-or-mesh-2-4ghz-antenna).


|Particle Device|Frequency     |Antenna Type|Manufacturer|MFG. Part # | Gain      |
|:--------------|:-------------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:----------|
|Argon          | 2400-2500 MHz|PCB Antenna |Particle    | ANT-FLXV2  |2.0dBi peak|

It is also possible to use most antennas designed for Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz) as a BLE antenna. In some cases, a u.FL to RP-SMA adapter will be required. If you are building a product using alternative antennas, additional certification may be required. 


### Peripherals and GPIO

| Peripheral Type | Qty | Input(I) / Output(O) |
| :---:|:---:|:---:|
| Digital | 20 | I/O |

| SPI  | 1 | I/O |
| I2C  | 2 | I/O |
| USB  | 1 | I/O |
| PWM  | 8| O |

**Note:** All GPIOs are only rated at 3.3VDC max.

### SWD

## Product Handling

### ESD Precautions

The Argon contains highly sensitive electronic circuitry and is an Electrostatic Sensitive Device (ESD). Handling Argon without proper ESD protection may destroy or damage it permanently. Proper ESD handling and packaging procedures must be applied throughout the processing, handling and operation of any application that incorporates Argon. ESD precautions should be implemented on the application board where the Argon is mounted. Failure to observe these precautions can result in severe damage to the Argon!

### Connectors

There are four connectors on the Argon that will get damaged with improper usage. The JST connector on the circuit board, where you plug in the LiPo battery, is very durable but the connector on the battery itself is not. When unplugging the battery, take extra precaution to **NOT** pull the connector using the wires, but instead hold the plug at its base to avoid putting stress on the wires. This can be tricky with bare hands - needle nose pliers are your friend here.

<div align=center><img src="/assets/images/lipo-connection.png" ></div>

The micro B USB connector on the Argon is soldered on the PCB with large surface pads as well as couple of through hole anchor points. Despite this reinforcement, it is very easy to rip out the connector if too much stress is put on in the vertical direction.

<div align=center><img src="/assets/images/proper-usb-connection.png" ></div>

The U.FL antenna connector is not designed to be constantly plugged and unplugged. The antenna pin is static sensitive and you can destroy the radio with improper handling. A tiny dab of glue (epoxy, rubber cement, liquid tape or hot glue) on the connector can be used to securely hold the plug in place.

The 10 pin SWD connector provides an easy in-system debugging access to the device. The pins on the connector can easily be damaged if the mating connector cable is inserted improperly. If you are trying to debug the device, you probably are already not in a good mood. The last thing you want is to render the connector useless. Be nice and be gentle with the connector. Good luck with the debugging!

### Breadboarding

The breadboard provided with the Argon is specifically designed to require low insertion force. This makes it easy to plug the Argon in and out of the breadboard. If you end up using a different breadboard, remember that it may require more force. In this case, always remember to pinch-hold your precious Argon by the sides (along the header pins) when plugging-unplugging and not by the USB connector (don't be this person).

## Default settings

The Argon comes preprogrammed with a bootloader and a user application called Tinker. This application works with an iOS and Android app also named Tinker that allows you to very easily toggle digital pins, take analog and digital readings and drive variable PWM outputs.

The bootloader allows you to easily update the user application via several different methods, USB, OTA, Serial Y-Modem, and also internally via the Factory Reset procedure. All of these methods have multiple tools associated with them as well.
