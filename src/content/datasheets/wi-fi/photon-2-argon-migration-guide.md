The Photon 2 is a development module with a microcontroller and Wi-Fi networking. The form-factor is similar to the Argon (Adafruit Feather), but
the Photon 2 supports 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi, BLE, and has much larger RAM and flash that can support larger applications. 

It is intended to replace both the Photon and Argon modules. It contains the same module as the P2, making it easier to migrate from a pin-based development module to a SMD mass-production module if desired.

<sup>1</sup>A small amount of the flash file system is used by Device OS, most is available for user data storage using the POSIX filesystem API. This is separate from the flash memory used for Device OS, user application, and OTA transfers.

<sup>2</sup> Total RAM; amount available to user applications is smaller.

<sup>3</sup> Total built-in flash; amount available to user applications is smaller. The Argon also has a 4 MB external flash, a portion of which is available to user applications as a flash file system.

<sup>4</sup> Onboard or external antenna is selectable in software.

There are two Photon 2 migration guides, depending on what you are migrating from:

- [From Photon](/datasheets/wi-fi/photon-2-photon-migration-guide/)
- [From Argon](/datasheets/wi-fi/photon-2-argon-migration-guide/)

## Hardware 

### Antennas

The Argon requires an external Wi-Fi antenna, and has a built-in chip antenna for BLE. It can optionally use an external chip antenna.

The Photon 2 has a built-in trace antenna that is shared by Wi-Fi and BLE. It can optionally use an external 2.4 GHz antenna for both Wi-Fi and BLE.

### SPI

Pins for both `SPI` and `SPI1` are unchanged between the Argon and Photon 2.

- Any available GPIO can be used for SS/CS (chip select) pins.
- Each SPI device must have a unique CS pin.
- The Argon supports SPI slave mode only on `SPI1` (D pins).

### Serial (UART)


The primary UART serial (`Serial1`) is on the TX and RX pins on both the Photon 2 and Argon. There is no hardware flow control on this port on the Photon 2 or Argon.

The secondary UART serial (`Serial2`) is on different pins, however it does not conflict with the RGB LED, and also supports CTS/RTS hardware flow control.

There is a third UART serial (`Serial3`) on the Photon 2 that also supports optional CTS/RTS hardware flow control.

### Analog input (ADC)

For analog to digital conversion (ADC) using `analogRead()`.

- Pin A0, A1, A2, and A5 are analog inputs on both the Argon and Photon 2.
- Pins A3 and A4 are only analog inputs on the Argon.
- Pins D0 and D1 can also be used as analog inputs on the Photon 2. 
- The `setADCSampleTime()` function is not supported on the Photon 2 or P2.

### PWM (Pulse-width modulation)

The pins that support PWM are different on the Argon and Photon 2.

{{!-- END do not edit content above, it is automatically generated 0fc429e8-585e-4f36-9874-e3fa37a1136e --}}

All available PWM pins on the Photon 2 share a single timer. This means that they must all share a single frequency, but can have different duty cycles.

### CAN (Controller Area Network)

Neither the Argon nor the Photon 2 support CAN.

- The Tracker SoM includes CAN via a MCP25625 CAN interface with integrated transceiver.
- Both the MCP2515 and MCP25625 work with [the library](https://github.com/particle-iot/can-mcp25x) used on the Tracker and can be used to add CAN to the Photon 2.


### I2S (Sound)

The Argon supports I2S (sound) input and output with a third-party library.

There is no software support for I2S on the Photon 2, and while the RTL872x hardware supports I2S, the pins that it requires are in use by other ports.

### Interrupts

All pins can be used for interrupts on Gen 3 devices and the Photon 2.

There is a limit of 8 pin interrupts on the Argon; this limitation does not exist on the Photon 2.

### Retained memory

Retained memory, also referred to as Backup RAM or SRAM, that is preserved across device reset, is not available on the Photon 2. This also prevents system usage of retained memory, including session resumption on reset.

On Gen 2 and Gen 3 devices, retained memory is 3068 bytes. 

The flash file system can be used for data storage on the Photon 2, however care must be taken to avoid excessive wear of the flash for frequently changing data.

### USB

The Photon 2 has a USB C connector, like the Tracker One and Tracker Eval Board.

The Argon has a Micro USB B connector.

### NFC Tag

The Photon 2 does not have NFC Tag support. The Argon does.

## Software

### Wi-Fi Configuration

The Photon 2 and Argon utilize BLE for configuration of Wi-Fi. Using BLE allow mobile apps to more easily set up the device Wi-Fi without having to modify the mobile device's network configuration. A React Native reference will be provided to simplify Wi-Fi setup.

Neither the Photon 2 nor Argon use the Wi-Fi based setup (SoftAP) that is used on the Photon and P1.

### BLE (Bluetooth LE)

- BLE long-range (coded PHY) is not supported on the Photon 2. It is on the Argon with Device OS 3.1 or later.

### Platform ID

The Platform ID of the Photon 2 will different from that of the Argon (12) because of the vastly different hardware. 

If you have a product based on the Argon, you will need to create a separate product for devices using the Photon 2. While you may be able to use the same source code to build your application, the firmware binaries uploaded to the console will be different, so they need to be separate products. This generally does not affect billing as only the number of devices, not the number of products, is counted toward your plan limits.

### Third-party libraries

Most third-party libraries are believed to be compatible. The exceptions include:

- Libraries that use peripherals that are not present (such as DAC)
- Libraries for MCU-specific features (such as ADC DMA)
- Libraries that are hardcoded to support only certain platforms by their PLATFORM_ID
