## Functional description

### Overview

The Photon 2 is a development module with a microcontroller and Wi-Fi networking. The form-factor is similar to the Argon (Adafruit Feather), but
the Photon 2 supports 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi, BLE, and has much larger RAM and flash that can support larger applications. 

It is intended to replace both the Photon and Argon modules. It contains the same module as the P2, making it easier to migrate from a pin-based development module to a SMD mass-production module if desired.

### Features

- 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi, 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz
  - Integrated PCB antenna
  - Integrated U.FL connector for external antenna
  - Integrated RF switch
- BLE 5 using same antenna as Wi-Fi
- Realtek RTL8721DM MCU
  - ARM Cortex M4F CPU, 200 MHz
- 2048 KB (2 MB) user application maximum size
- 2 MB flash file system
- FCC, IC, and CE certified


## Interfaces

### Block Diagram

{{imageOverlay src="/assets/images/photon2-block-diagram.png" alt="Block Diagram" class="full-width"}}

### Power

#### USB C
The USB C port is the easiest way to power up the Photon 2. Please make sure that the USB port is able to provide at least 500mA. 

#### VUSB Pin
The pin is internally connected to the VBUS of the USB port. The nominal output should be around 4.5 to 5 VDC when the device is plugged into the USB port and 0 when not connected to a USB source. You can use this pin to power peripherals that operate at such voltages. Do not exceed the current rating of the USB port, which is nominally rated to 500mA.  This pin is also protected with an internal fuse rated at 1000mA.

It is also possible to use the VUSB to power the Photon 2 if not using the USB port. 

#### LiPo
If you want to make your projects truly wireless, you can power the device with a single cell LiPo (3.7V). The Photon 2 has an on board LiPo charger that will charge and power the device when USB source is plugged in or power the device from the LiPo alone in the absence of the USB.

{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed warningBox"}}
**NOTE:**
Please pay attention to the polarity of the JST-PH LiPo connector. Not all LiPo batteries follow the same polarity convention!
{{box op="end"}}

![LiPo Polarity](/assets/images/lipo-polarity.png)

#### Li+ PIN
This pin is internally connected to the positive terminal of the LiPo connector. You can connect a single cell LiPo/Lithium Ion or a DC supply source to this pin for powering the Argon. Remember that the input voltage range on this pin is 3.6 to 4.2 VDC. 

#### 3V3 PIN
This pin is the output of the on board 3.3V step-down switching regulator. The regulator is rated at 500mA max. When using this pin to power other devices or peripherals remember to budget in the current requirement of the Argon first. This pin can also be used to power the Argon in absence of the USB or LiPo power. When powering over this pin, please connect the ENABLE pin to GND so that the on board regulator is disabled.

#### EN PIN

The **EN** pin is not a power pin, per se, but it controls the 3V3 power. The EN pin is pulled high by a 100K resistor to the higher of VUSB, the micro USB connector, or Li+. Because the pull-up can result in voltages near 5V you should never directly connect EN to a 3.3V GPIO pin. Instead, you should only pull EN low, such as by using an N-channel MOSFET or other open-collector transistor.

The EN pin can force the device into a deep power-down state where it uses very little power. It also can used to assure that the device is completely reset, similar to unplugging it, with one caveat:

If using the EN pin to deeply reset the device, you must be careful not to allow leakage current back into the nRF52 MCU by GPIO or by pull-ups to 3V3. If you only power external devices by 3V3 you won't run into this, as 3V3 is de-powered when EN is low. 

However, if you have circuitry that is powered by a separate, external power supply, you must be careful. An externally powered circuit that drives a nRF52 GPIO high when EN is low can provide enough current to keep the nRF52 from powering down and resetting. Likewise, a pull-up to an external power supply can do the same thing. Be sure that in no circumstances can power by supplied to the nRF52 when 3V3 is de-powered.

### Antennna

- The Photon 2 includes an on-module PCB trace antenna and a U.FL connector that allows the user to connect an external antenna.
- The antenna is selected in software. The default is the PCB trace antenna.
- A single antenna is used for both Wi-Fi and BLE.

### SWD/JTAG

The Photon 2 module supports programming and debugging use SWD (Serial Wire Debug) using the 10-pin micro JTAG connector on the top of the module.

When the bootloader starts, for a brief period of time a weak pull-up is applied to pin D8 and pull-down to pin D6 to detect whether a SWD debugger is attached. After boot, you can use these pins for regular GPIO, but beware of a possible GPIO state change caused by the pull-up or pull-down when using these pins as output.

| Pin   | JTAG   | MCU Pin| Pull at boot |
| :---: | :----: | :----: | :----------: |
| D8    | SWDIO  | PA[27] | Pull-up      |
| D6    | SWCLK  | PB[3]  | Pull-down    |
| 3V3   | Power  |        |              |
| GND   | Ground |        |              |
| RST   | Reset  |        |              |

### Flash Layout Overview

[To be provided at a later date.]

### DCT Layout

[This information is from the P1, and is likely to remain the same, but is subject to change.]

The DCT area of flash memory has been mapped to a separate DFU media device so that we can incrementally update the application data. This allows one item (say, server public key) to be updated without erasing the other items.

_DCT layout in `release/stable`_ <a href="https://github.com/particle-iot/device-os/blob/release/stable/platform/MCU/STM32F2xx/SPARK_Firmware_Driver/inc/dct.h" target="_blank">found here in firmware.</a>

**Note:** Writing 0xFF to offset 34 (DEFAULT) or 3106 (ALTERNATE) will cause the device to re-generate a new private key on the next boot. Alternate keys are currently unsupported on the P1 but are used on the Electron as UDP/ECC keys.  You should not need to use this feature unless your keys are corrupted.

```
// Regenerate Default Keys
echo -en "\xFF" > fillbyte && dfu-util -d 2b04:d00a -a 1 -s 34 -D fillbyte
// Regenerate Alternate Keys
echo -en "\xFF" > fillbyte && dfu-util -d 2b04:d00a -a 1 -s 3106 -D fillbyte
```

- The Photon 2 is designed to compliant with the Adafruit Feather form-factor (2.0" x 0.9")
- It has male header pins on the bottom of the module
- Unlike the Argon and Boron, the Photon 2 uses SMD pins on the bottom because the P2 module is too wide to fit between two rows of PTH pins 0.8" apart
- It will not be available in a "no headers" version as there are components on the bottom side of the board

### Mating connectors

The Photon 2 uses two single row 0.1" pitch male header pins. One of them is 16 pin while the other is 12 pin. It can be mounted with matching 0.1" pitch female headers with a typical height of 0.335" (8.5mm). When you search for parts like these it can be difficult to navigate the thousands of parts available online so here are a few good choices for the Photon 2 and Argon:

## Product handling

### Tape and Reel Info

[To be provided at a later date.]

### Moisture sensitivity levels

<i class="icon-attention"></i> The Moisture Sensitivity Level (MSL) relates to the packaging and handling precautions required. The P1 module is rated level 3. In general, this precaution applies for Photons without headers.  When reflowing a P1 directly onto an application PCB, increased moisture levels prior to reflow can damage sensitive electronics on the P1.  A bake process to reduce moisture may be required. <i class="icon-attention"></i>

<i class="icon-right-hand"></i>For more information regarding moisture sensitivity levels, labeling, storage and drying see the MSL standard see IPC/JEDEC J-STD-020 (can be downloaded from [www.jedec.org](http://www.jedec.org)).

### ESD Precautions

<i class="icon-attention"></i> The P1 module contains highly sensitive electronic circuitry and is an Electrostatic Sensitive Device (ESD). Handling a P1 module without proper ESD protection may destroy or damage it permanently.  Proper ESD handling and packaging procedures must be applied throughout the processing, handling and operation of any application that incorporates P1 modules.  ESD precautions should be implemented on the application board where the P1 module is mounted. Failure to observe these precautions can result in severe damage to the P1 module! <i class="icon-attention"></i>

## Default settings

The P2 module comes pre-programmed with a bootloader and a user application called Tinker.  This application works with an iOS and Android app also named Tinker that allows you to very easily toggle digital pins, take analog and digital readings and drive variable PWM outputs.

The bootloader allows you to easily update the user application via several different methods, USB, OTA, Serial Y-Modem, and also internally via the Factory Reset procedure.  All of these methods have multiple tools associated with them as well.

You may use the [Particle Web IDE](https://build.particle.io) to code, compile and flash a user application OTA (Over The Air). [Particle Workbench](/quickstart/workbench/) is a full-featured desktop IDE for Windows, Mac, and Linux based on VSCode and supports both cloud-based and local gcc-arm compiles. The [Particle CLI](/tutorials/developer-tools/cli/) provides a command-line interface for cloud-based compiles and flashing code over USB.
