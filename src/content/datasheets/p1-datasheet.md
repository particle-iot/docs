## Functional description

### Overview

The P1 is Particle's tiny Wi-Fi module that contains both the Broadcom Wi-Fi chip and a reprogrammable STM32F205RGY6 32-bit ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller. The P1 comes preloaded with Particle firmware libraries, just like our dev kits, and it's designed to simplify your transition from prototype to production. The P1 is the PØ's big brother; it's a bit bigger and a tad more expensive, but it includes some extra flash and an antenna and u.FL connector on board.  Every P1 includes free cloud service.

## Interfaces

### Block Diagram

<div align=center><img src="/assets/images/p1-block-diagram.png" width=600></div>

### Power

Power to the P1 is supplied via 3 different inputs: VBAT_WL (pin 2 & 3), VDDIO_3V3_WL (pin 5), VDD_3V3 (pin 26 & 27).  Optionally +3.3V may be supplied to VBAT_MICRO (pin 38) for data retention in low power sleep modes. Each of these inputs also requires a 0.1uF and 10uF ceramic decoupling capacitor, located as close as possible to the pin (see Fig 1). The voltage should be regulated between 3.0VDC and 3.6VDC.

Typical average current consumption is 80mA with 5V @ input of the recommended SMPS power supply with Wi-Fi on. Deep sleep quiescent current is typically 80uA (Please refer to [Recommended Operating Conditions](#recommended-operating-conditions) for more info).  When powering the P1 make sure the power supply can handle 600mA continuous. If a lesser power supply is provided, peak currents drawn from the P1 when transmitting and receiving will result in voltage sag at the input which may cause a system brown out or intermittent operation.  Likewise, the power source should be sufficient enough to source 1A of current to be on the safe side.

<br><br><b>Fig. 1</b> Recommended power connections with decoupling capacitors.</div>

### RF

The RF section of the P1 includes an on-board PCB trace antenna and a u.FL connector which allows the user to connect an external antenna.  These two antenna outputs are selectable via a user API, made possible by an integrated RF switch.

The default selected antenna will be the PCB antenna.

The area surrounding the PCB antenna on the carrier PCB should be free of ground planes and signal traces for maximum Wi-Fi performance.

### Peripherals and GPIO

The P1 module has ton of capability in a super small footprint, with analog, digital and communication interfaces.

**Note:** P1 pin names will be preserved as they are named in the USI datasheet, however for the scope of this datasheet we will also refer to them as their Photon and code equivalents, i.e. D7 instead of MICRO_JTAG_TMS and A2 instead of MICRO_GPIO_13.  This will help to simplify descriptions, while providing a quick reference for code that can be written for the P1 such as `int value = analogRead(A2);`

| Peripheral Type | Qty | Input(I) / Output(O) | FT<sup>[1]</sup> / 3V3<sup>[2]</sup> |
| :-:|:-:|:-:|:-: |
| Digital | 24 | I/O | FT/3V3 |
| Analog (ADC) | 13 | I | 3V3 |
| Analog (DAC) | 2 | O | 3V3 |
| SPI | 2 | I/O | 3V3 |
| I2S | 1 | I/O | 3V3 |
| I2C | 1 | I/O | FT |
| CAN | 1 | I/O | FT |
| USB | 1 | I/O | 3V3 |
| PWM | 11<sup>3</sup> | O | 3V3 |

**Notes:**

<sup>[1]</sup> FT = 5.0V tolerant pins.  All pins except A3 and DAC are 5V tolerant (when not in analog mode). If used as a 5V input the pull-up/pull-down resistor must be disabled.

<sup>[2]</sup> 3V3 = 3.3V max pins.

<sup>[3]</sup> PWM is available on D0, D1, D2, D3, A4, A5, WKP, RX, TX, P1S0, P1S1 with a caveat: PWM timer peripheral is duplicated on two pins (A5/D2) and (A4/D3) for 7 total independent PWM outputs. For example: PWM may be used on A5 while D2 is used as a GPIO, or D2 as a PWM while A5 is used as an analog input. However A5 and D2 cannot be used as independently controlled PWM outputs at the same time.

### RGB LED, SETUP and RESET button

When using the P1 module, it is very important to remember that your device must have an RGB LED to show the user the connectivity status.  Also required is a SETUP and RESET button to enter various [Device Modes](/guide/getting-started/modes). By default the RGB LED outputs are configured for a Common Anode type of LED. These components should be wired according to the [P1 Reference Design - User I/O](#schematic-user-i-o).  RGB pins may be accessed in code as: RGBR, RGBG and RGBB.

### JTAG and SWD

Pin D3 through D7 are JTAG interface pins.  These can be used to reprogram your P1 bootloader or user firmware image with standard JTAG tools such as the ST-Link v2, J-Link, R-Link, OLIMEX ARM-USB-TINI-H, and also the FTDI-based Particle JTAG Programmer. If you are short on available pins, you may also use SWD mode which requires less connections.

| Photon Pin | JTAG | SWD | STM32F205RGY6 Pin | P1 Pin # | P1 Pin Name | Default Internal<sup>[1]</sup> |
| :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:- |
| D7 | JTAG_TMS | SWD/SWDIO | PA13 | 54 | MICRO_JTAG_TMS | ~40k pull-up |
| D6 | JTAG_TCK | CLK/SWCLK | PA14 | 55 | MICRO_JTAG_TCK | ~40k pull-down |
| D5 | JTAG_TDI | | PA15 | 53 | MICRO_JTAG_TDI | ~40k pull-up |
| D4 | JTAG_TDO | | PB3 | 54 | MICRO_JTAG_TDO | Floating |
| D3 | JTAG_TRST | | PB4 | 51 | MICRO_JTAG_TRSTN | ~40k pull-up |
| 3V3 | Power | Power | | | | |
| GND | Ground | Ground | | | | |
| RST | Reset | Reset | | | | |

**Notes:**
<sup>[1]</sup> Default state after reset for a short period of time before these pins are restored to GPIO (if JTAG debugging is not required, i.e. `USE_SWD_JTAG=y` is not specified on the command line.)

A standard 20-pin 0.1" shrouded male JTAG interface connector should be wired as follows:

### External Coexistence Interface

The P1 supports coexistence with Bluetooth and other external radios via three pins available on the P1 module.

When two radios occupying the same frequency band are used in the same system, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, a coexistence interface can be used to coordinate transmit activity, to ensure optimal performance by arbitrating conflicts between the two radios.

| P1 Pin Name | P1 Pin # | I/O | Description |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-|
| BTCX_RF_ACTIVE | 57 | I | Coexistence signal: Bluetooth is active |
| BTCX_STATUS | 56 | I | Coexistence signal: Bluetooth priority status and TX/RX direction |
| BTCX_TXCONF | 58 | O | Output giving Bluetooth permission to TX |
￼
When these pins are programmed to be used as a Bluetooth coexistence interface, they're set as high impedance on power up and reset.

## Memory Map

### STM32F205RGY6 Flash Layout Overview

- Bootloader (16 KB)
- DCT1 (16 KB), stores Wi-Fi credentials, keys, mfg info, system flags, etc..
- DCT2 (16 KB), swap area for DCT1
- EEPROM emulation bank 1 (16 KB)
- EEPROM emulation bank 2 (64 KB) [only 16k used]
- System firmware (512 KB) [256 KB Wi-Fi/comms + 256 KB hal/platform/services]
- Factory backup, OTA backup and user application (384 KB) [3 x 128 KB]

### DCT Layout

The DCT area of flash memory has been mapped to a separate DFU media device so that we can incrementally update the application data. This allows one item (say, server public key) to be updated without erasing the other items.

_DCT layout as of v0.4.9_ [found here in firmware](https://github.com/spark/firmware/blob/develop/platform/MCU/STM32F2xx/SPARK_Firmware_Driver/inc/dct.h)

**Note:** Writing 0xFF to offset 34 (DEFAULT) or 3106 (ALTERNATE) will cause the device to re-generate a new private key on the next boot. Alternate keys are currently unsupported on the P1 but are used on the Electron as UDP/ECC keys.  You should not need to use this feature unless your keys are corrupted.

```
// Regenerate Default Keys
echo -e "\xFF" > fillbyte && dfu-util -d 2b04:d00a -a 1 -s 34 -D fillbyte
// Regenerate Alternate Keys
echo -e "\xFF" > fillbyte && dfu-util -d 2b04:d00a -a 1 -s 3106 -D fillbyte
```

## Pin and button definition

### Pin markings

<div align=center><img src="/assets/images/p1-pin-numbers.png" width=600></div>

### Pin description

| Pin | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| RST | Active-low reset input. On-board circuitry contains a 1k ohm pull-up resistor between RST and 3V3, and 0.1uF capacitor between RST and GND. |
| VBAT | Supply to the internal RTC, backup registers and SRAM when 3V3 not present (1.65 to 3.6VDC). |
| 3V3  | This pin represents the regulated +3.3V DC power to the P1 module.  In reality, +3.3V must be supplied to 3 different inputs: VBAT_WL (pin 2 & 3), VDDIO_3V3_WL (pin 5), VDD_3V3 (pin 26 & 27). Optionally +3.3V may be supplied to VBAT_MICRO (pin 38) for data retention in low power sleep modes. Each of these inputs also requires a 0.1uF and 10uF ceramic decoupling capacitor, located as close as possible to the pin. |
| D0~D7 | Digital only GPIO pins. D0~D3 may also be used as a PWM output. |
| A0~A7 | 12-bit Analog-to-Digital (A/D) inputs (0-4095), and also digital GPIOs. `A6` and `A7` are code convenience mappings, which means pins are not actually labeled as such but you may use code like `analogRead(A7)`.  `A6` maps to the DAC pin and `A7` maps to the WKP pin. A4,A5,A7 may also be used as a PWM output. |
| DAC   | 12-bit Digital-to-Analog (D/A) output (0-4095), and also a digital GPIO. DAC is used as `DAC` or `DAC1` in software, and A3 is a second DAC output used as `DAC2` in software. |
| RX    | Primarily used as UART RX, but can also be used as a digital GPIO or PWM. |
| TX    | Primarily used as UART TX, but can also be used as a digital GPIO or PWM. |
| P1S0 | 12-bit Analog-to-Digital (A/D) inputs (0-4095), and also can be used as a digital GPIO or PWM. |
| P1S1 | 12-bit Analog-to-Digital (A/D) inputs (0-4095), and also can be used as a digital GPIO or PWM. |
| P1S2 | 12-bit Analog-to-Digital (A/D) inputs (0-4095), and also can be used as a digital GPIO. |
| P1S3 | 12-bit Analog-to-Digital (A/D) inputs (0-4095), and also can be used as a digital GPIO. |
| P1S4 | Primarily used as a digital GPIO. |
| P1S5 | 12-bit Analog-to-Digital (A/D) inputs (0-4095), and also can be used as a digital GPIO. |

## Product handling

### Tape and Reel Info

<div align=center><img src="/assets/images/p1-tape-and-reel.png" width=600></div>

### Moisture sensitivity levels

<i class="icon-attention"></i> The Moisture Sensitivity Level (MSL) relates to the packaging and handling precautions required. The P1 module is rated level 3. In general, this precaution applies for Photons without headers.  When reflowing a P1 directly onto an application PCB, increased moisture levels prior to reflow can damage sensitive electronics on the P1.  A bake process to reduce moisture may be required. <i class="icon-attention"></i>

<i class="icon-right-hand"></i>For more information regarding moisture sensitivity levels, labeling, storage and drying see the MSL standard see IPC/JEDEC J-STD-020 (can be downloaded from [www.jedec.org](http://www.jedec.org)).

### ESD Precautions

<i class="icon-attention"></i> The P1 module contains highly sensitive electronic circuitry and is an Electrostatic Sensitive Device (ESD). Handling a P1 module without proper ESD protection may destroy or damage it permanently.  Proper ESD handling and packaging procedures must be applied throughout the processing, handling and operation of any application that incorporates P1 modules.  ESD precautions should be implemented on the application board where the P1 module is mounted. Failure to observe these precautions can result in severe damage to the P1 module! <i class="icon-attention"></i>

## Default settings

The P1 module comes preprogrammed with a bootloader and a user application called Tinker.  This application works with an iOS and Android app also named Tinker that allows you to very easily toggle digital pins, take analog and digital readings and drive variable PWM outputs.

The bootloader allows you to easily update the user application via several different methods, USB, OTA, Serial Y-Modem, and also internally via the Factory Reset procedure.  All of these methods have multiple tools associated with them as well.

You may use the online Web IDE [Particle Build](https://build.particle.io/) to code, compile and flash a user application OTA (Over The Air).  [Particle Dev](https://www.particle.io/dev) is a local tool that uses the Cloud to compile and flash OTA as well.  There is also a package `Spark DFU-UTIL` for Particle Dev that allows for Cloud compiling and local flashing via DFU over USB.  This requires `dfu-util` to be installed on your system.  'dfu-util' can also be used with [Particle CLI](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli) for Cloud compiling and local flashing via the command line.  Finally the lowest level of development is available via the [GNU GCC toolchain for ARM](https://github.com/spark/firmware), which offers local compile and flash via dfu-util.  This gives the user complete control of all source code and flashing methods.  This is an extensive list, however not exhaustive.
