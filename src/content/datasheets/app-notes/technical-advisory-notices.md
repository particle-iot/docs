# Technical Advisory Notices

Technical Advisory Notices are issued for hardware issues and typically include:

- An issue summary
- Products that are affected (and how to identify if your product is affected)
- Issue resolutions and workarounds

The list can be found on the support site in the [Technical Advisory Notices](https://support.particle.io/hc/en-us/sections/360009578414-Technical-Advisory-Notices) section.

## By Product Family

### Tracker System

- [TAN002 - Tracker One v1.0 Shipping Mode](https://support.particle.io/hc/en-us/articles/360052713714-TAN002-Tracker-One-v1-0-Shipping-Mode) Shipping mode issue impacting Tracker One v1.0 devices manufactured before August 31, 2020.
- [TAN006 - Tracker SoM GNSS Interface](https://support.particle.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412220540571)

### Boron/B Series SoM

- [TAN001 - SARA-R410M "124-day"](https://support.particle.io/hc/en-us/articles/360052556854-TAN001-SARA-R410M-124-day-) Power-off procedure recommendations for Particle devices running u-blox SARA-R410M-02B modules
- [TAN003 - B402 RF Circuit Component](https://support.particle.io/hc/en-us/articles/1260801078410) A manufacturing run of B402 SOMs in week 28 of 2020 mis-populated 10K resistors in place of 15pF capacitors in the RF matching circuit. This can lead to weakened connectivity and component heating.
