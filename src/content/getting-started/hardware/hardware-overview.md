*Finding the right Particle hardware for your project*

## Off-the-shelf complete

Particle gateway devices contain a cellular communication module in an enclosure with the required antennas and certification. IP67-rated waterproof connectors makes it easy to add external sensors and devices that communicate over protocols such as CAN bus, serial, and I2C. 

### Tracker One

If you want an off-the-shelf device can requires little or no hardware design, the [Tracker One](/reference/datasheets/tracker/tracker-one/) is a complete system with a waterproof IP67-rated enclosure. In includes cellular connectivity, GNSS (GPS) and Wi-Fi geolocation, and motion detection.

![M-SoM](/assets/images/m-series/m404-iso.jpg)

### B-SoM

The B-SoM includes only cellular (not Wi-Fi, satellite, or LoRaWAN). It uses the same M.2 NGFF socket as the M-SoM, though there are some minor differences because of the use of differnet MCUs (Realtek RTL8722 in M-SoM and Nordic nRF52840 in B-SoM).

![B-SoM](/assets/images/b-series/b404x-iso.png)

### P2

The P2 is a Wi-Fi only module using the Realtek RTL8721DM module. The MCU is very similar to the M-SoM MCU, with the same fast speed and large amount of flash and RAM, making it useful for low-cost devices performing computationally intensive edge computing tasks, including running machine learning models.

The P2 must be reflow soldered to a base board. For prototyping, see the [Photon 2](#photon-2), below.

- [P2 datasheet](/reference/datasheets/wi-fi/p2-datasheet/)

P2 modules are available from [store.particle.io](https://store.particle.io/) as cut tape in quantities of 10 each.

The M404 is fully supported in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It is in beta testing in other locations. See the [carrier list](/reference/cellular/cellular-carriers/?tab=Msom&region=byRegion) for country compatibility information.

The Muon can be used in a number of ways:

- As a prototyping device, as-is, or using Dupont wires to connect to a solderless breadboard.
- Expanded using Sparkfun [Qwiic](/hardware/expansion/qwiic/) and Adafruit STEMMA QT plug-and-play I2C sensors and peripherals.
- Design your own expansion card, either as a prototype or for production.
- Incorporate the features of the Muon into your own design based on the M-SoM.

### Photon 2

The Photon 2 is a prototyping module for Wi-Fi networks based on the P2 module. It is an Adafruit Feather form-factor with pins on the bottom that are ideal for use in a solderless breadboard.

Since it contains a P2 module, you can also use it as a development kit for creating your own product based on a P2 module, as software is fully compatible between the two devices.

### Boron

The Boron is a prototyping module for cellular networks. It is an Adafruit Feather form-factor with pins on the bottom that are ideal for use in a solderless breadboard.

- [Boron datasheet](/reference/datasheets/b-series/boron-datasheet/)

There is no Boron version for EMEAA (Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia), as the LTE Cat 1 with 2G/3G fallback cellular modem on the B524 would not physically fit in the Feather form-factor.
