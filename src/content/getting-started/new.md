## Updates

{{!--
When adding new items to this page:

- New items go newest first be;low this comment
- Be sure to follow the header style exactly: A L3 (###) header, followed by a short description, then the date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Make sure MM and DD have a leading 0 if < 10.

The header format must be exactly that because the search feature uses that to delimit entries, and determine the date of entries

Clicking on a search result now displays a in-document search results panel with the sections that match
your query. This is especially useful for long pages where it's not clear where you should scroll to.
For example [API users](/reference/cloud-apis/api/?q=api+user).

### Device OS 5.6.0 2023-12-08

Device OS 5.6.0 is now available in Device Restore DFU, Device Restore JTAG, hex file generator, etc.. Release notes are updated in the docs [release note viewer](/reference/device-os/release-notes/).

Fixed a bug in Device Restore USB on the P2 and Photon 2 (RTL872x) where if both prebootloader-part1 and bootloader required an upgrade, the bootloader might not upgrade (even with the flash even if version unchanged option is set). This was most noticeable if upgrading a P2/Photon 2 to 5.3.0 with no Wi-Fi credentials so the bootloader would not upgrade OTA.

### Documentation for analogSetReference 2023-11-08

Documented [analogSetReference()](/reference/device-os/api/input-output/analogsetreference/) and analogGetReference(), added in 5.3.0 and 4.1.0.
