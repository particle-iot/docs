Ledger is in beta and is not recommended for production applications. There may be breaking changes to the behavior 
and APIs in future versions based on user feedback. 

Pricing and availability may change in the future.

Ledger requires Device OS 6.1.0 or later.
{{box op="end"}}

One use case of a Cloud to Device ledger is storing configuration parameters. You can store data per organization, owner, product, or device. You can implement your own hierarchy (product with device overrides, for example). If ledger values are changed while the device is online, it will generally receive the update quickly, within 30 seconds. If the device is offline, it will receive the updates when the device connects to the cloud again.

## Sandbox product

In order to use Ledger, you will need to:

- Create a product for testing in your developer sandbox. There is no additional charge for this.
- Add one or more devices to the product.

Ledger can only be used with devices in products; it cannot be used with individual developer devices.

## Create a ledger

Create a new **Cloud to Device ledger** for your configuration data. Go to the [Particle console](https://console.particle.io/) and select the **Ledger** icon in your developer sandbox. 

{{imageOverlay src="/assets/images/ledger/ledger-select.png" class="no-darken"}}

Create a new device to cloud ledger named **test-config-defaults**. You may need to rename it if the name is already in use; if you do, you will need to update the device firmware so the names match. This should be a **Product** scoped ledger.

### Create product ledger instance

This example uses structured data to hold more complex configuration parameters. First set product default values. In the **test-config-defaults** ledger create a new instance for the product your devices are in.

{{imageOverlay src="/assets/images/ledger/config-product-instance.png" class="no-darken"}}

Using the **Advanced** tab, enter this JSON data:

```json
{
    "temp": {
        "min": 20,
        "max": 30
    },
    "hum": {
        "min": 10,
        "max": 80
    }
}
```


## Device firmware

This is the test device firmware. It requires Device OS 6.1.0 or later.

{{> project-browser project="ledger-config" default-file="src/ledger-config.cpp" height="400"}}

Walking through the code:

This example uses three ledgers:

- `sensors` for send sensor values from the device to the cloud, same as the [Ledger Sensor](/getting-started/logic-ledger/ledger-sensor/) example.
- `defaultConfig` for the product default configuration (cloud to device).
- `deviceConfig` for the device-specific overrides (cloud to device).

```cpp
Ledger sensors;            // Device to cloud
Ledger defaultConfig;      // Cloud to device, product defaults
Ledger deviceConfig;       // Cloud to device, device-specific overrides
```

This example updated the ledger once per minute. You can change this here. For example, to update every 5 minutes, change `60s` to `5min`.

```cpp
const std::chrono::milliseconds sensorCheckPeriod = 60s;
```

In `setup()` this code waits for the USB serial debug terminal to connect for 10 seconds before proceeding. This is useful for debugging but you will remove this from a real application.

```cpp
void setup() {
    // The next line is for debugging and waits for USB serial debug to connect for 10 seconds so you can see more early log messages
    waitFor(Serial.isConnected, 10000);
```

This initializes the ledgers. You can either register a synchronization callback, or just read the ledger when you need to use it. This example does both, however the sync callback doesn't really do anything.

The `sensors` ledger is device to cloud, so there is no synchronization callback.

```cpp
// Start ledger synchronization
defaultConfig = Particle.ledger("test-config-defaults");
defaultConfig.onSync(syncCallback);

deviceConfig = Particle.ledger("test-config-device");
deviceConfig.onSync(syncCallback);

sensors = Particle.ledger("sensors");
```

This is where we write the fake sensor data (temperature and humidity) to the ledger. The `data` variable is a local copy of the structured ledger data, though in this case it only consists of two number (double) keys, `temp` and `hum`, and a String timestamps `time`.

```cpp
// Save the value to the ledger
Variant data;
data.set("temp", temp);
data.set("hum", hum);
if (Time.isValid()) {
    data.set("time", Time.format(TIME_FORMAT_ISO8601_FULL)); // Time.format returns a String
}
```

To save this data to the cloud, we use the `set()` method of `Ledger`. This call is asynchronous.

```cpp
// Save in ledger and output to serial debug log
sensors.set(data);
Log.info("set ledger %s", data.toJSON().c_str());
```

In the `getValue()` function you can see one pattern for reading values from a ledger. 

```cpp
bool getValue(const char *group, const char *key, Variant &value) {
    bool hasKey = false;

    LedgerData defaultData = defaultConfig.get();
    if (defaultData.has(group)) {
        if (defaultData[group].has(key)) {
            value = defaultData[group].get(key);
            hasKey = true;
        }
    }
```

This example is reading this JSON:

```json
{
    "temp": {
        "min": 20,
        "max": 30
    },
    "hum": {
        "min": 10,
        "max": 80
    }
}
```

The `group` parameter is `temp` or `hum` and is the outer JSON key.

The `key` parameter is the inner object key, `min` or `max`.

Use the `get()` method in your global `Ledger` object to get a `LedgerData` object. 

Use the `has()` method to check if a key exists. 

`operator[]` is used to get a reference to a `Variant` in the data, for example: `defaultData[group]`. Be sure to check if the key exists before using this operator, however!

Then the `has()` method can be used to see if the inner `key` exists (such as `min` or `max`),

To get the value as a `Variant`, use the `get()` method. Then use a method like `toInt()`, `toDouble()`, or `toString()` to convert it to the actual type you want.


Logs from running the code will typically look like this:

```
0000022048 [app] INFO: set ledger {"hum":21.1,"temp":43.9,"time":"2024-01-17T12:00:56Z"}
```

The first time you request the ledgers you may also see logs like this:

```
0000021784 [system.ledger] INFO: Requesting ledger info
0000022178 [system.ledger] INFO: Received ledger info
0000022470 [system.ledger] INFO: Subscribing to ledger updates
0000022775 [system.ledger] INFO: Subscribed to ledger updates
```

## Configuration

The configuration in **test-config-defaults* was set above. If you edit this ledger in the console, you'll see this message in the logs.

```
0000237165 [app] INFO: syncCallback called
```

If the `temp` or `hum` is not within the `min` to `max` range, the ledger will include an `alarm` key:

```
0000141147 [app] INFO: temp value=19.600000 not in bounds, min=20.000000 max=30.000000
0000141163 [app] INFO: hum value=32.200000 in bounds, min=10.000000 max=80.000000
0000141428 [app] INFO: set ledger {"alarm":["temp"],"hum":32.2,"temp":19.6,"time":"2024-01-17T13:50:51Z"}
```

This is generated from `checkLimits()` by this line of code. That this does is get a reference to the `alarm` key in the `data` object, which is what we'll store in the ledger. If the key does not exist, it will be created. Then the `append()` method of `Variant` is called. If the parent element is not an array, it will be converted to a `VariantArray`. Then the new element (`group`) is appended to the array.

```cpp
data["alarm"].append(group);
```


### Device-specific overrides

The code supports product defaults with device-specific overrides. A device-scoped cloud to device ledger was created earlier, but now we'll test it.

You'll need the device ID (24 character hex) for the device you want to override.


Open **Ledger**, then **test-config-device**. Click **Instances** then **Create new instance**.

{{imageOverlay src="/assets/images/ledger/config-create-device-ledger.png" class="no-darken"}}

Enter the Device ID and click **Advanced** and enter this JSON:

```json
{
    "temp": {
        "min": 40,
        "max": 50
    }
}
```

{{imageOverlay src="/assets/images/ledger/config-device-value.png" class="no-darken"}}


Then, in the USB serial debug log, you should see something like this:

```
0000022797 [system.ledger] INFO: Subscribed to ledger updates
0000080121 [app] INFO: syncCallback called
0000082388 [app] INFO: temp value=4.800000 not in bounds, min=40.000000 max=50.000000
0000082405 [app] INFO: hum value=19.500000 in bounds, min=10.000000 max=80.000000
0000082664 [app] INFO: set ledger {"alarm":["temp"],"hum":19.5,"temp":4.8,"time":"2024-01-17T14:29:22Z"}
```

Note that for `temp` (temperature), the min and max values have changed from 20 - 30 to 40 - 50.

## Push notification

This example is part of a pair of examples illustrating how to do push notification alerts using two different techniques:

- Configuration via Ledger, device generates alerts (this example)
- [Device generates data, Logic generates alerts in the cloud](/getting-started/logic-ledger/logic-cloud-alerts/)

One option for alerting is to use a push notification service. This example uses [Pushover](/integrations/community-integrations/pushover/). Follow the instructions in that page to create an integration that trigger from the event `push-notification`. It's recommended that you create the integration in the product you are testing with.

Then, in the device firmware, uncomment the `Particle.publish()` command:

```cpp
void alertUser(const char *msg) {
    if (Particle.connected()) {
        // Uncomment the following line to enable push notification alerts
        Particle.publish("push-notification", msg);
    }
    Log.info("alertUser %s", msg);
}
```

Flash your device and in an alert condition it should send a push notification.

The USB serial debug log will show something like this:

```
0000441154 [app] INFO: alertUser temp 9.400000 not in range 20.000000 to 30.000000 0a10aced202194944a02c53c
```

## Cleanup

Ledger information is kept on the device even after you remove the firmware that uses Ledger. To clean up this data
see the documentation for [Ledger::removeAll()](/reference/device-os/api/ledger/removeall-ledger-class/) in the Device OS 
firmware API reference.

## Next steps

In this simple demo, we're viewing the data in the console, but you might want to do additional processing using Logic. 

You could also read the data using the [Particle Cloud API](/reference/cloud-apis/api/#ledger) from a web page or external application.

For an example of a device to cloud Ledger and writing data to a Ledger, see the [Ledger Sensor](/getting-started/logic-ledger/ledger-sensor/) example.
