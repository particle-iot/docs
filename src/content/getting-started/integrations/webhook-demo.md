# {{title}}

This is an interactive tutorial that shows how to use Particle.publish to send data from a Particle device to a cloud service by a webhook. You'd use a technique like this for sending sensor or location data from your Particle device to the Particle cloud and then to your servers via a webhook.


In order to use this tutorial, you must be logged into your Particle account:

{{> sso}}

## Cloud setup

In this section we'll set up a product, add your device, and create a webhook.

### Select a device

It works best if you already have a Particle device set up and claimed to your account, but you can still go through parts of this tutorial without a device. Just skip to the next step if you don't have a device yet.

{{> webhook-demo-select-device}}


### Select a product

You should typically start with a product. You'll eventually need one to scale, and it makes it easier to group devices. This demo requires a product, and you should generally create a new one just for this demo.

{{> webhook-demo-select-product}}

You can find all of your sandbox products in the {{webhook-demo-link link="sandbox/products" text="productsTab"}} in the Particle console.

### Add device to product

Whenever you have a product, you must add devices to it. When you scale, you will typically add all of the devices in your order at once, as you will be emailed a list of the Device IDs in your order. 

In the growth and enterprise plans, just adding the Device ID to the product does not affect billing; billing only starts the first time the device connects to the Particle cloud.

{{> webhook-demo-add-device}}

You will normally use the **Add Devices** button in the {{webhook-demo-link link="devices" text="devices tab"}} in the console to do this in your real products.

### Start demo

Starting the demo will start the webhook server and start monitoring events.

{{> webhook-demo-start}}


### Create a product webhook

Normally you'll create a webhook in your product from the console. Because the server URL changes every time you start the demo, the tutorial will just create it for you automatically.

| Parameter | Value | 
| :--- | :--- |
| Event | WebhookDemo01 |
| URL | <span class="webhookUrlSpan"></span> |
| Method | POST |

You can {{webhook-demo-link link="webhook" text="open the webhook in the console"}} once it has been created.

{{> webhook-demo-webhook }}

{{collapse op="start" label="Tell me more about creating a webhook"}}

Each webhook contains a number of parameters. In this webhook:

- The event name. When an event is published from the device or API, if the event name begins with this string, the webhook will be triggered. 
Note that this is a prefix match, not a string match! This is why the event name is set to `WebhookDemo01`. If it were just `WebhookDemo` it would trigger on 
`WebhookDemo` as well as `WebhookDemo02`, which is probably not what you want to do. However, you can take advantage of the prefix to use a single 
webhook to handle multiple things, which is easier to maintain than a large number of webhooks.
- `integration_type`: This is `webhook`. There are special integrations for Azure, Google Cloud, etc. but this is the setting to connect to your own server.
- `headers`: This specifies any additional headers to pass to your server. This demo includes two:
  - `Content-Type`: The kind of data we're sending from the webhook.
  - `Authorization`: This is optional, but provides a good way to authenticate your webhook, described in greater detail below.
- `url`: The server URL. This will change every time you run the demo or refresh this page. This is specific to how this demo runs in your browser; your server URL will probably not change. 
Note that this URL is https (TLS/SSL encrypted). This is not required, but highly recommended for security reasons.
- `noDefaults`: This indicates that default fields should not be added to the POST data, as we manage them ourselves.
- `method`: The demo server expects POST. Other common methods are GET, PUT, and DELETE.
- `body`: This is the data that will be sent to your server. This will be explained in more detail below.
- `responseTopic`: When the response from the webhook server is returned, this is the event that is used. You device may want to subscribe to this to get the result on-device.
- `errorEesponseTopic`: When the webhook server returns an error, this is the event that is used. 

**Body**

The `body` declaration creates a new JSON-formatted object containing:

- The requesting Device ID (it's `api` if testing the webhook).
- A timestamp when the event was received by the Particle cloud (not the time it was generated on-device).
- A key `sensor` which contains the JSON object that the device published. This allows the device to send additional fields without having to modify the webhook.

**Data operations**

- Every time a device publishes an event, it incurs one data operation. 
- The webhook usage is not metered
- If you subscribe to an responseTopic on your device, it will count as an additional data operation, thus counting as two total in most cases.
- Make sure you configure the responseTopic correctly, however, as doing it incorrectly can cause an avalanche of data operations in large fleets!

**Response topic**

The response topic is `{{{PARTICLE_DEVICE_ID}}}/hook-response/{{{PARTICLE_EVENT_NAME}}}`. The reason it begins with `{{{PARTICLE_DEVICE_ID}}}` is that it 
allows the device to subscribe to responses only from webhooks it triggers. If you left this out, the device would receive the response from every device
in your fleet, which is probably not what you want, and will cause a huge number of data operations to be used.

**Chained events**

You cannot chain webhooks. In other words, if you create a webhook that has an event name corresponding to a response topic (hook-response), it will never be triggered. 
This is done to prevent loops, which could easily get out of control causing excessive data operations and server load.

**Security**

To help secure your webhook:

- Be sure you are using https (TLS/SSL encrypted).
- Use a valid SSL certificate from a known provider (not a self-signed certificate).
- Including a `Authorization` header in the webhook with a pre-shared random key can make your connection more secure if you also check it in your server.

### Test webhook

{{> webhook-demo-test }}

{{collapse op="start" label="Tell me more about testing a webhook"}}
This is similar, but not the same, as the **Test** button in the {{webhook-demo-link link="webhook" text="webhook configuration"}} in the console.

This button publishes and event using the Particle cloud API, but it includes simulated data, similar to what the device firmware below sends.

When you use the API to create an event, the source Device ID is "api" instead of an actual Device ID. You cannot simulate sending from a Device ID
using the API. This is intentional to prevent being able to spoof data from a device.
{{collapse op="end"}}


### Explainer 

Once you start the demo and events start flowing, either by using the Test button above, or from a device, the section below will explain what is happening.

{{> webhook-demo-explainer }}


### Webhook server data

The table below is the decoded data that was received by the webhook server. This is the kind of data that you'd be able to use in a custom web or mobile app, but you'd probably use something fancier than just a table.

{{> webhook-demo-data-table }}

{{collapse op="start" label="Tell me more about server data"}}
In this demo, the webhook sends POST data in JSON format. The server data shown is the decoded version of this data.

Additionally, fields that you sent up from the device are also broken out into their own columns.

This demo is just to show decoded data. In you server, you'd probably do something more useful than just displaying it in a table. You might store the data in a database, do calculations with the data, or alert on values out of range.
{{collapse op="end"}}

### Event log

This control shows the same information that is shown in the {{webhook-demo-link link="events" text="events tab"}} in your product so you don't need to switch between multiple windows.

{{> webhook-demo-events }}


### Your device fleet

This control shows the status of devices in your product fleet. It's similar to the {{webhook-demo-link link="devices" text="devices tab"}} in your product in the console.

{{> webhook-demo-fleet }}

## Device firmware

{{> project-browser project="webhook-demo" default-file="src/webhook-demo.cpp" height="400" flash="true"}}

### Firmware deep dive

This is standard boilerplate you'll see in most applications.

- Using `SerialLogHandler` is preferable to using `Serial.print` for debugging.
- You should always use `SYSTEM_THREAD(ENABLED)`.

```cpp
#include "Particle.h"
SerialLogHandler logHandler;
SYSTEM_THREAD(ENABLED);
```

The code defines the name of the event to publish here. If the name of the webhook prefix matches this string, the webhook will fire. For example:

| Event | Webhook is run? |
| :--- | :---: |
| `WebhookDemo01` | Yes |
| `WebhookDemo` | No |
| `SomethingElse` | No |
| `WebhookDemo011` | Yes |
| `WebhookDemo01Test` | Yes |

```cpp
const char *eventName = "WebhookDemo01";
```

This sets how often the firmware publishes, in this example, every 5 minutes, starting immediately after connecting to the cloud. Other examples would be "30s" for 30 seconds or "1h" for 1 hour. Beware of short intervals as they can use a large number of data operations!

Hint: `lastPublishMillis` could be initialized to 0 instead. This would wait 5 minutes before the first publish. This is a good safety net because if a bug causes your device to reboot continuously, it could result in an excessively large number of publishes.

```cpp
const std::chrono::milliseconds publishInterval = 5min;
unsigned long lastPublishMillis = -publishInterval.count();
```

These global variables are described below, where they're used.

```cpp
int hookSequence = 0;
bool buttonClicked = false;
```

These are forward declarations - function names that are used before they are implemented in the .cpp file. 

If your main source file is .ino instead of .cpp, you don't need forward declarations because they're generated for you, but it's better programming practice to use .cpp files and include them explicitly.

```cpp
void hookResponseHandler(const char *event, const char *data);
void clickHandler(system_event_t event, int param);
float readTemperature();
void publishSensorData();
```

This is the standard setup function. The first thing it does is register a handler to receive the hook-response. This must match what is configured in the webhook.

Note that the event name begins with the Device ID (24 character hexadecimal). This is done so the device only receives the hook response for the events
that this device publishes. If you don't do this in both the webhook and the C++ source code, then the device will receive a response for any device in the 
product that publishes to the webhook, which is probably not what you want, and can generate a very large number of data operations.

```cpp
void setup() 
{
    Particle.subscribe(System.deviceID() + "/hook-response/" + String(eventName), hookResponseHandler);
```

This code also publishes when you click the MODE button. You probably won't do this in your production code, but it's handy during testing.

```cpp
    // Register a click handler for the MODE button
System.on(button_click, clickHandler);
```    

When this code publishes an event, it includes an id number in it that increases with each publish. This is good practice, and it makes it easier 
to de-dupe events received multiple times. It is possible for your webhook to be called more than once for the same event in the case that the
event ACK is lost. A sequence number makes it easier to detect this.

While it's usually fine to start with a sequence of 0, another option is to seed it with a random number. In order for it to actually be random
you need to wait until after connected to the Particle cloud. At boot, the `rand()` function is not only pseudo-random, but unseeded so every device
at boot has the same value of `rand()`. Once cloud connected it gets seeded from a random number from the cloud. At that point, it's still
pseudo-random (linear congruential generator, LCG, as implemented in glibc), but at least it will start from a different random point.

```cpp
if (hookSequence == 0 && Particle.connected())
{
    // Wait until Particle.connected because the rand() is seeded from the cloud
    hookSequence = rand();
}
```

This is how time-based publishes work. Additionally:

- Always check `Particle.connected()` before attempting to publish.
- When doing time-based calculations, always follow the pattern here. Storing the next time to publish and other techniques can fail when the `millis()` counter rolls over to 0 every 49 days. The code as written here is safe cross rollover.

```cpp
if (Particle.connected() && millis() - lastPublishMillis >= publishInterval.count()) {
    lastPublishMillis = millis();

    publishSensorData();
}
```

The button handler can run as an interrupt service routine, so you can't publish directly from the handler. Instead, set a flag and handle it from loop. If you are using a physical button connected to a GPIO, don't forget to add debouncing code.

```cpp
if (buttonClicked)
{
    buttonClicked = false;
    if (Particle.connected()) {
        publishSensorData();
    }
}
```

This code doesn't really do anything with the webhook response; it just writes it to the USB serial debug console. But you could add code here to do something more useful.

Don't publish from a subscription handler! They share a single buffer and the data will be corrupted.

```cpp
void hookResponseHandler(const char *event, const char *data)
{
    Log.info("hook response %s", data);
}
```

This function just simulates data so you don't need to wire up an actual temperature sensor to your device. You could replace this code with code that actually reads a temperature sensor.

```cpp
float readTemperatureC() 
{
    // This code doesn't actually read the temperature, it just returns a random number,
    // but you could easily put the code to read an actual sensor here.
    static float lastTemperatureC = -100;

    if (lastTemperatureC != -100) {
        lastTemperatureC += (float) ((rand() % 6) - 3);
    }
    else {
        lastTemperatureC = (float) (rand() % 40);
    }
    return lastTemperatureC;
}
```

This is the function that is called to publish data to the Particle cloud. 

- A buffer is allocated to hold the event, which can be up to 1024 bytes of data.
- Formatting the data in the publish as JSON is recommended for flexibility and easy of maintenance. 
- The `JSONBufferWriter` makes this easy.

```cpp
void publishSensorData()
{
    char publishDataBuf[particle::protocol::MAX_EVENT_DATA_LENGTH + 1];

    JSONBufferWriter writer(publishDataBuf, sizeof(publishDataBuf) - 1);

    float temperatureC = readTemperatureC();
```

This is the code to add things to the event:

- `id` is the sequential `hookSequence` value, used for de-duplicating events.
- `t` is the temperature from `readTemperatureC()` (a made-up value).
- On cellular devices with a bq24195 PMIC and fuel gauge, the `powerSource` and battery state-of-charge (`soc`) are included.
- You can easily add more data here without having to modify the webhook!

```cpp
writer.beginObject();
writer.name("id").value(hookSequence++);
writer.name("t").value(temperatureC);
#if HAL_PLATFORM_POWER_MANAGEMENT
writer.name("powerSource").value(System.powerSource());
writer.name("soc").value(System.batteryCharge());
#endif
writer.endObject();
writer.buffer()[std::min(writer.bufferSize(), writer.dataSize())] = 0;
```

And finally publish the data to the Particle cloud. You may see example code that includes `PRIVATE`, which is no longer necessary as all events are private. 

```cpp
Particle.publish(eventName, publishDataBuf);
```

### Open in Workbench

The recommended development environment for Particle firmware is [Particle Workbench](/workbench/). To open this project in Workbench:

- Use the **Download Full Project (*.zip)** option in [Device Firmware](#device-firmware), above.
- Extract the zip file on your computer.
- Open Visual Studio Code
- Use the File - Open option to open the directory you just extracted. Make sure you open the directory, not a single file in it.

Most operations are in the **command palette** (Ctrl-Shift-P on Windows and Linux, Command-Shift-P on Mac). Some useful commands:

- **Particle: Login** Log into your Particle account.
- **Particle: Configure Project for Device** Set the type of device and the version of Device OS you want to use.
- **Particle: Cloud flash** Compile the project and flash it to a device OTA.
- **Particle: Cloud compile** Compile the project and download the .bin file.


### Device logs

If you have your Particle device connected by USB to your computer (Windows, Linux, Mac, or Chromebook), and you are using the Chrome web browser, you can monitor your device's USB serial debug log from this interactive control. You can also use `particle serial monitor` from the Particle CLI if you prefer. Both are optional, but are good for troubleshooting.

{{> usb-serial-console}}


## More things to try

### Expand your device fleet

Use the **Add Devices** button in the {{webhook-demo-link link="devices" text="devices tab"}} in the console to add another device to your project.

You can monitor both devices from this page!


### Upload product firmware

Use Workbench to build a firmware binary, then upload the binary to {{webhook-demo-link link="firmware" text="firmware tab"}} in your product in the console.

You can use this to flash all devices in your product fleet with new firmware in just a few clicks.

Also, once you set default product firmware and add a device, it will be immediately flashed with your product firmware if online, or automatically when it next comes online.

### Add more data fields

Try adding additional data fields to your product firmware using the `JSONWriter`. You can add integer, floating point, and string variables easily. These will automatically be included via 
the webhook and will show up in the data table.

### Add a real sensor

Instead of just using random data, try connecting a real temperature sensor and hooking it up into the `readTemperatureC()` function.

## Clean up

If you are done using this tutorial, you can clean up the things that were created during this tutorial.

{{> webhook-demo-cleanup }}

Don't forget to turn off your device or flash different firmware (or Tinker) to it so it doesn't continue to publish events and use data operations.
