# {{title}}

Device groups allow you to define subsets of your IoT deployment that can
be addressed separately from the rest of the fleet. Groups provide the flexibility
and granularity you need to manage a connected product at scale.

your IoT deployment</p>

Segmenting devices into groups allows you to manage an IoT fleet with
more specificity,
like the ability to [rollout firmware by group](#firmware-release-by-group). As an example,
a business serving customers around the world can now target devices to run a different
version of firmware depending on the local country's native language.

Stay tuned as we add more ways to leverage device groups in your product.

## Creating Device Groups

In order to get the benefits of device segmentation, you will first need
to create a group.

A group is scoped to a Particle product, and can be applied to any number of devices in the
fleet. A group can be created using the
<a href="https://console.particle.io"
target="_blank">Particle Console</a>. Visit your product's devices view
(<i class="im-devices-icon"></i>) and click the "New Group" button:

![New group button](/assets/images/device-groups/new-group-btn.png)

<p class="caption">You will find the 'New Group' button on your
product's devices page.</p>

After clicking this button, the _New Device Group_ modal will appear:

![New group modal](/assets/images/device-groups/new-device-group.png)

Give your group a unique name that allows you to quickly identify its
purpose. You can optionally provide a description and a thumbnail color.
Some examples of groups you may wish to create:

- **Prerelease Group**: Target this subset of devices to receive
"bleeding-edge" firmwares for early testing. This can help you get user
feedback and/or identify potential firmware bugs before releasing to the rest of the fleet.
- **Group by Geographic Region**: Devices that are deployed in various
parts of the world may need to be addressed differently. Segment device
behavior, or run different versions of firmware.
- **Group by Permissions**: You may have distributors, service partners,
or customers that need access to certain device groups.

_Quick tip_: If you prefer, you can also [call the Particle
API](/reference/cloud-apis/api/#create-device-group) directly to create a device
group.

## Assigning Groups to Devices

Now that you have created your group(s), you'll need to assign groups
to devices in your fleet. Note that **a device can belong to multiple
groups**, as you will likely need to segment your fleet
along many different axes.

To assign a single device to a group, click on it from your product's
devices view (<i class="im-devices-icon"></i>). Then, click the **+ Add
groups** button as shown in the device header:

<img class="full-width" alt="Assign group to device" src="/assets/images/device-groups/assign-group-to-device.png"/>

The page will enter into an edit mode. Apply groups to the device
using the dropdown, and click the **Done** button to save. You can
assign devices to existing groups, or create a new group and assign it
to the device. You can come back here and click the **Edit** button on a
device to update its group memberships at any time.

You can also assign many devices to a group at the same time. If you
have grouping enabled for your product, you should see checkboxes next
to each approved device visible on your product's device view. Select
some devices, and click the **Edit groups** button that appears:

<img class="full-width" alt="Batch edit groups"
src="/assets/images/device-groups/batch-edit-groups.png"/>
<p class="caption">Edit groups of many devices at once
using the Console</p>

You will then be presented with a modal that will allow you to batch
update groups of the selected devices. **Note that editing groups for a
device may result in the device being targeted for an OTA firmware
update**, due to product firmware releases by group.

_Quick tip_: If you prefer, you can also [call the Particle API](/reference/cloud-apis/api/#batch-assign-groups-to-devices) directly to assign groups to a device.

_Quick tip_: After assigning groups to devices, you can use the Console
or the [Particle API](/reference/cloud-apis/api/#list-devices-in-a-product) to filter product devices by group.

## Firmware Release by Group

With devices segmented into groups, it is now possible to gain more
control and flexibility over the firmware release process. If you are
unfamiliar with how to rollout firmware to a product fleet, please check
out the [Particle Console
Guide](/getting-started/console/console/#rollout-firmware) before
continuing.

With grouping enabled, you can *release a product firmware to one or
more groups*,
or choose to mark the version as the *Product default* release.
Releasing firmware to a group will target a only subset of the product
fleet to receive the binary (those devices that belong to that group).

Marking as the Product default, in
contrast, sets the firmware as the default firmware version
available to all devices in the fleet to download and run.
The specific firmware chosen to be delivered to a
given device is determined by *precedence rules*, which you can read about in
the next section.

### Firmware Precedence Rules

Devices in your fleet will be targeted to
receive a version of product firmware according to these precedence
rules:

- A **development device** never receives automatic updates of product
firmware.

- A device that has been **individually locked** to a version of product
firmware is respected above all else, and will not be overwritten by any
released firmwares.

- If unlocked, devices **belonging to a group** will receive the
corresponding group's released firmware (if a firmware has been released
to the group). When a device belongs to multiple groups that each have
released firmware, the _highest firmware version_ will be preferred

- If a device is unlocked and **does not belong to any groups** with
released firmware, it will receive the **Product default** released
firmware (if a firmware has been released as the Product default)

- If none of the above conditions result in a device being targeted for
a product firmware, it will not receive an automatic OTA update from the
Particle cloud

### Example Release Process

Let's walk through a real-life example of how you could use
releasing product firmware by group. Imagine you have a fleet of 5,000
internet-connected widgets in the field. They are all currently running
version 1 of your product firmware (v1 had been previously marked as the
default product firmware).

After some initial feedback from end-users, you and your engineering
team add a few impressive new features. You upload this new version of
firmware to your product:

<img class="full-width" alt="The new flashy firmware" src="/assets/images/device-groups/release-firmware-1.png"/>

You've tested out the firmware on one of your internal development
devices, and are ready to roll it out to devices in the field. However,
you still aren't completely certain how this new code will perform in
the wild and would like to mitigate risk as much as possible.

Luckily, you've defined a `prerelease` group. This group contains 15
devices belonging to customers that have opted-in to receiving
bleeding-edge firmware. Let's go ahead and release version 2 to the
`prerelease` group to target those eager customers.

To do this, click on **<i class="ion-star"></i>&nbsp;Release this firmware** when hovering over v2.
The *Release Firmware* modal will appear. Use the dropdown to select
`prerelease` from the available groups:

![Releasing to prerelease](/assets/images/device-groups/release-firmware-2.png)

Click **Next**. You will now be asked to confirm the action you are about
to take. Releasing firmware to devices deployed in the field always comes with
some risk, so use the confirmation screen to ensure you're releasing the
right firmware to the right devices:

![Confirm release](/assets/images/device-groups/release-firmware-3.png)
<p class="caption">Always confirm the version, targeted group(s) and impacted
devices before releasing firmware to your
device fleet to ensure you are taking the desired action</p>

Looks good! We see that we are releasing version 2 of firmware to the
`prerelease` group, which should impact the 15 devices that belong to
this group. Note that *impacted devices* refers specifically to the
number of devices that will receive an OTA firmware update as a direct
result of this action.

Click **<i class="ion-star"></i>&nbsp;Release this firmware** to confirm
the action. Nice! We've now released v2 to the `prerelease` group. You
should now see the group tag appear next to the firmware version:

<img class="full-width" alt="Successful release"
src="/assets/images/device-groups/release-firmware-4.png"/>

Note that the devices will not receive the firmware immediately;
instead, they will be targeted for an over-the-air update the next time
they start a new secure session with the cloud (this is called a
*handshake*).

## From Device Firmware

Normally device groups are used to manage devices in the console and for releasing product firmware. However, by using a webhook and some device firmware, you can get the device group list from user firmware running on a Particle device.

A 3rd-party library, [DeviceGroupHelperRK](https://github.com/rickkas7/DeviceGroupHelperRK) is available to make this easier. It is also available when using **Particle: Install Library** in Particle Workbench or in the community libraries in the Web IDE. Or you can use the technique shown in the library directly into your own firmware.
