### Reporting bugs and feedback

- Follow the instructions in [this community forum post](https://community.particle.io/t/how-to-report-bugs-and-provide-feedback/52361) to report bugs or provide feedback.

- The [Developer Tools - Workbench Category](https://community.particle.io/c/dt/particle-workbench/43) in the community forums should be used for Workbench support.

### Working with a custom Device OS build

It's possible to work with a non-released branch, fork, or manually merged PRs of Device OS.

* Get the latest Device OS source from GitHub. You'll need to have the command line version of git available in order to retrieve the submodules.

```
git clone git@github.com:particle-iot/device-os.git
cd ./device-os
git checkout develop
git submodule update --init --recursive

```

* Launch Visual Studio Code
* Navigate to your Particle settings ([docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings)) and set the `Custom Device OS Location`

![Particle Global Settings](/assets/images/support/settings-custom-deviceos-location.png)

* Enter the absolute path to your Device OS source code and reload when prompted
* Open a Particle project and open a source file
* Click on the Device OS entry in the status bar to display a list of available toolchains

![Particle Project Settings](/assets/images/support/statusbar-project-settings.png)

* Select the `deviceOS@source` entry - it should be first in the list
* Wait for the toolchain to install and activate
* Run commands ([docs](/getting-started/developer-tools/workbench/#particle-commands)) and local compilation tasks as normal ([docs](/getting-started/developer-tools/workbench/#local-build-and-flash))

### Error: Unable to load manifest

```
Unable to load manifest for: ~/path/to/device-os - attempted to load: ~/path/to/device-os/.workbench/manifest.json

```

Workbench attempts to load a manifest located within the Device OS source repository. If that file isn't available or if you've somehow incorrectly set the `Custom Device OS Location` setting, you'll see this error.

### Uninstalling Workbench

* Open VSCode.
* Click the **Extensions** button on the left toolbar (Activity bar).
* Click on the gear icon for the **Workbench** extension and select **Uninstall**.
* Repeat for the **C/C++** and **Cortex-Debug** extensions
* Close and re-open VSCode, then close it again.
* Delete the `~/.particle/toolchains` directory.

### Uninstalling VSCode

#### Mac

* Find your `Visual Studio Code.app` file (typically in `~/Applications` or `/Applications`)
* Delete `Visual Studio Code.app`

#### Windows

* Open **Add/Remove Programs**.
* Select **Microsoft Visual Studio Code** and click the **Uninstall** button

#### Linux

* Open a terminal
* Run `sudo apt-get purge code`. This currently only works with Ubuntu and other Debian-style distributions.

### Linux Tips

* On 64-bit Linux you may need to install 32-bit libraries:

```
sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib libarchive-zip-perl libncurses-dev

```

* If you get a permission error when debugging, you may need to add udev rules.  
   * If you have the [Particle Workbench](/workbench/), run the `Particle: Launch CLI` command and then run `particle usb configure` in the terminal that launches  
   * if you just have the [Particle CLI](/getting-started/developer-tools/cli/), open a terminal and run `particle usb configure`  
   * Otherwise, you can download [50-particle.rules](https://github.com/particle-iot/particle-cli/blob/master/assets/50-particle.rules) and copy it to `/etc/udev/rules.d/`
