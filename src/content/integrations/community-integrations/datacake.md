*Integrate Particle with Datacake using webhooks*

Datacake is a low-code IoT dashboarding tool that makes it easy to visualize data from Particle devices. With Datacake, you can create rich dashboards that can be passed down to your end customer. Particle paired with Datacake can be a powerful configuration when developing connected devices.

But, Datacake recently adjusted the way they integrate with Particle devices. In this post, we‚Äôll explore how to set up a Particle integration using Datacake‚Äôs new webhook paradigm.

## Configuring Datacake

The following steps will heavily reference [documentation from Datacake](https://docs.datacake.de/integrations/webhook), this is worth reviewing.

<aside>
üí°

You‚Äôll need to sign up for a Datacake account if you don‚Äôt already have one. 

</aside>

First, Navigate to the dashboard and create a new API device.

![add-new-device.png](/assets/images/integrations/datacake/add-new-device.png)

Create a new product for this device, or use an existing product if you‚Äôve used Datacake in the past. 

![create-product.png](/assets/images/integrations/datacake/create-product.png)

Next, you‚Äôll be prompted to create a new device. In this example, we‚Äôll let Datacake auto generate the serial number and name the device `ParticleDemo-001`.

![new-product-device.png](/assets/images/integrations/datacake/new-product-device.png)

Choose the free tier and continue. From the ‚Äúall devices‚Äù view, select the device that you‚Äôve just created. Navigate to configuration > fields > add a field. 

![add-field.png](/assets/images/integrations/datacake/add-field.png)

In this example, we‚Äôll publish a counter from the Particle device for a simple demonstration. So we‚Äôll select the integer type, give it a name of `counter` and leave the remaining settings as the default. 

![field-config.png](/assets/images/integrations/datacake/field-config.png)

<aside>
üí°

It‚Äôs worth mentioning that the field you‚Äôve just added is product wide, it is not scoped to the device alone. All additional devices in the product class will receive this field.

</aside>

While still in the ‚Äúconfiguration‚Äù tab, select the ‚ÄúProduct & Hardware‚Äù submenu. 

![product-hardware-config.png](/assets/images/integrations/datacake/product-hardware-config.png)

Scroll down until you see the ‚ÄúHTTP Payload Decoder‚Äù section. Replace the context of the text box with the following. 

Before doing so, it might be worth reading through the sample code to get a better understanding what is possible with the decoder.

```js
function Decoder(request) {
    var payload = JSON.parse(request.body)
    console.log(payload.device)
    return payload
}
```

![payload-decoder.png](/assets/images/integrations/datacake/payload-decoder.png)

Scroll down a bit more to the ‚ÄúHTTP endpoint URL‚Äù subsection and copy this value, we‚Äôll need it for the Particle configuration. 

![endpoint-url.png](/assets/images/integrations/datacake/endpoint-url.png)

## Particle webhook configuration

Navigate to the Particle console and [set up a new device](https://setup.particle.io/) if you haven‚Äôt already. Once your device is activated and associated with a product, we can configure our new webhook. From your **product level view** navigate to Cloud services > Integrations. Search for ‚ÄúDatacake‚Äù and choose ‚ÄúStart now‚Äù.

![data-cake-integration.png](/assets/images/integrations/datacake/data-cake-integration.png)

In the webhook builder, give the integration a name, and replace the URL with the value you copied in the previous step.

![data-cake-integration-config.png](/assets/images/integrations/datacake/data-cake-integration-config.png)

Expand the ‚ÄúExtra settings‚Äù submenu and select the ‚ÄúCustom‚Äù option under ‚ÄúJSON DATA‚Äù. Paste in the following. Notice that the ‚Äúfield‚Äù key has the matching uppercase value from the previous step in the Datacake console.

```json
[
    {
        "device":"\{{{datacake_serial}}}",
        "field": "COUNTER",
        "value": \{{{counter}}}
    }
]
```

![custom-payload.png](/assets/images/integrations/datacake/custom-payload.png)

Scroll all the way down and save the new webhook.

## Firmware

The firmware for this example is straight forward, but we‚Äôll use it as an opportunity to introduce the [typed and extended publish features](/reference/device-os/typed-publish/) available in Device OS 6.3+. Notice how the publish is non-blocking! With this configuration can go about doing other operations in the firmware (such as monitor sensors) while the cloud publish resolves.

With a device that has been already assigned to the product that contains your Datacake integration, [flash the following sample code](/getting-started/developer-tools/workbench/#local-build-and-flash) with the latest Device OS available:

```cpp
#include "Particle.h"

SYSTEM_MODE(AUTOMATIC);

#define DATACAKE_SERIAL_NO "6beacdd3-c2a3-43b7-9ece-0da82687775e"

SerialLogHandler logHandler(LOG_LEVEL_INFO);

const std::chrono::milliseconds publishPeriod = 2min;
unsigned long lastPublish;
CloudEvent event;
int globalCount = 1;

void publishCounter();

void setup()
{
}

void loop()
{
    if (Particle.connected())
    {
        if (!event.isSending() && ((lastPublish == 0) || (millis() - lastPublish >= publishPeriod.count())))
        {
            lastPublish = millis();
            publishCounter();
        }
    }

    if (event.isSent())
    {
        Log.info("publish succeeded");
        globalCount++;
        event.clear();
    }
    else if (!event.isOk())
    {
        Log.info("publish failed error=%d", event.error());
        event.clear();
    }
}

void publishCounter()
{
    particle::Variant obj;
    obj.set("counter", globalCount);
    obj.set("datacake_serial", DATACAKE_SERIAL_NO);

    event.name("datacake-data");
    event.data(obj);
    Particle.publish(event);

    Log.info("publishing %s", obj.toJSON().c_str());
}
```

The above firmware simply publishes a count value once every 2 minutes. Notice, though, that the `datacake_serial` number is hard coded here. This is not a very scalable way to manage your devices. A better approach would be to use a [cloud to device](/getting-started/logic-ledger/ledger/#cloud-to-device-ledger-console), device scoped Ledger instance. 

At scale, you might implement a script that [creates a new Ledger instance](/reference/cloud-apis/api/#create-a-new-ledger-definition) for each device onboarded to Datacake. Then once the device comes, online it will sync itself with it‚Äôs Ledger instance and populate the Datacake serial number. 

## Testing

With our cloud services wired together, let‚Äôs test to make sure we‚Äôre properly sending our `COUNTER` to Datacake.

The first place to look is at the [device‚Äôs serial output](/firmware/best-practices/usb-serial/) for the ‚Äúpublished successfully‚Äù log.

Next, head over to the Particle Console and open the event view in the device details section. Confirm you see messages propagating through. 

![events-log.png](/assets/images/integrations/datacake/events-log.png)

With the events streaming into the Particle Cloud, we can now check on the status of the integration. Navigate to Cloud services > Integrations from the product level view. Click into the newly configured Datacake integration and scroll down to the history section. Confirm that your integration is being triggered without errors and containing the proper `data` field.

![integration-logs.png](/assets/images/integrations/datacake/integration-logs.png)

Now, we can confirm that the messages are being received by Datacake. Head back to your Datacake console and open detail view for the newly configured device. 

Navigate to the debug tab. You should see a list of recent events with the title: ‚Äú**Recorded measurements from API payload decoder‚Äù.** Confirm that you‚Äôre seeing the expected payload in the ‚ÄúDetails‚Äù section.

## Next steps

With that, you‚Äôre ready to start creating more [complex dashboards](https://docs.datacake.de/dashboards/public-dashboard) with data sent from your Particle device!
