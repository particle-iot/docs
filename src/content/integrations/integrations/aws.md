There are four AWS integrations available:

| Integration name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [AWS Lambda](#aws-lambda) | Serverless cloud computing service (via AWS API Gateway) |
| [AWS DynamoDB](#aws-dynamodb) | Managed NoSQL database |
| [AWS S3](#aws-s3) | Cloud storage (accessed via AWS Firehose) |
| [AWS SQS](#aws-sqs) | Message queueing service |


## AWS Lambda

### Lambda setup

1. Go to **Lambda** and click `Create function`.
2. Name your function and create it.
3. Update the code and make sure to deploy the changes.

### API Gateway setup

1. Go to **API Gateway** service and click on `Create API`.
2. Select `REST API` and `Build`.
3. Name the new API Gateway and `Create API`.
4. Click on `Create resource`.

5. Name your resource, this will be part of the path in your API request
    
![Create resource](/assets/images/integrations/aws/create-resource-2.png)
    
6. Now create a Method, for this example we will use POST
    
![Create method](/assets/images/integrations/aws/create-method.png)
    
7. Select `Lambda function` as integration type and choose your lambda in the dropdown.
    
![Create method lambda](/assets/images/integrations/aws/create-method-lambda.png)
    
8. Once the method is created, take note of its ARN. You will need it to set the right permissions to invoke it in the IAM policy.

9. Go back to your lambda function details and select `Deploy API`.
10. Select `*New stage*` option and name a first stage for the API.
    
![Deploy API](/assets/images/integrations/aws/deploy-api.png)
    
11. Once your stage is created, take not of the invoke URL, this is the URL needed to configure particle webhook.

### Policy creation - Lambda

Go to **Identity and Access Management** (**IAM**) and in **Policies** section select `Create policy` and go to the JSON editor. 

This is the base policy JSON with the minimal permission needed to invoke a **Lambda** through a POST method from an **API Gateway**. Set the ARN of the lambda as **Resource** in the policy and click `Next`.
   
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "execute-api:Invoke"
      ],
      "Resource": "<POST METHOD ARN>"
    }
  ]
}
```

Name your policy and click `Create policy` at the bottom of the page. Continue with the [AWS access configiration](#aws-access-configuration) steps below.

## AWS DynamoDB

DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

### Instructions

1. Obtain the ARN of your DynamoDB table from the AWS Management Console.
2. Ensure your AWS user has permissions to perform `dynamodb:PutItem` operations on the table.
3. In the webhook configuration, insert the ARN in the designated field and provide the AWS user's key pair for authentication.

Continue with the [AWS access configiration](#aws-access-configuration) steps below.

### Policy creation - DynamoDB

Go to **Identity and Access Management** (**IAM**) and in **Policies** section select `Create policy` and go to the JSON editor. 

This is the base policy JSON with the minimal actions needed to put items to a **DynamoDB table**. Set the ARN of the TABLE as **Resource** in the policy and click `Next`.
    
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "dynamodb:PutItem"
      ],
      "Resource": "<DYNAMO TABLE ARN>"
    }
  ]
}
```

Name your policy and click `Create policy` at the bottom of the page. Continue with the [AWS access configiration](#aws-access-configuration) steps below.



## AWS S3

AWS S3 is a scalable storage service, and AWS Kinesis Firehose is a service for delivering real-time streaming data to destinations such as S3.

### Instructions

1. Ensure your AWS user has the necessary permissions (**`firehose:PutRecord`**, **`firehose:PutRecordBatch`**) for the Kinesis Firehose stream.
2. Set up a Kinesis Firehose stream if not already done, and configure it to deliver data to your S3 bucket.
3. Obtain the name of your Kinesis Firehose stream.
4. In the webhook configuration, input the user's key pair for AWS authentication and the name of the Firehose stream to route data into your S3 bucket.

### S3 setup

1. Go to the S3 service and select `Create bucket`.
2. Note the bucket name.

### Firehose setup

1. Go to Amazon Data Firehose service and select `Create Firehose stream`.
2. Set `Direct PUT` as Source and `Amazon S3` as Destination.
    
![Firehose create](/assets/images/integrations/aws/firehose-create.png)
    
3. In **Destination settings** section set your S3 bucket as destination for the stream.
    
![Firehose destination](/assets/images/integrations/aws/firehose-destination.png)
    
4. IMPORTANT: In `New line delimiter`, select `Enabled`
5. Click on `Create Firehose stream` at the bottom of the page.
6. Note the newly created Firehose stream ARN.

### Policy creation - S3

Go to **Identity and Access Management** (**IAM**) and in **Policies** section select `Create policy` and go to the JSON editor. 

This is the base policy JSON with the minimal actions needed to write to the S3 bucket using a **Firehose stream**. Set the ARN of the Firebase stream as **Resource** in the policy and click `Next`.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",

      ],
      "Resource": "<FIREBASE ARN>"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Create an SQS queue if you do not have one already, and obtain its URL from the AWS Management Console.
3. In the webhook configuration, provide the queue URL to specify where messages should be sent and the user's key pair for AWS authentication.

### Policy creation - SQS

This is the base policy JSON with the minimal actions needed to send messages to a **SQS queue**. Set the ARN of the queue as **Resource** in the policy and click `Next`.
    
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",

      "Resource": "<SQS ARN>"
    }
  ]
}
```

Name your policy and click `Create policy` at the bottom of the page. Continue with the [AWS access configiration](#aws-access-configuration) steps below.

## AWS access configuration

These steps are used for all Amazon services.
