# Contributions

All contributors must first sign the [Particle Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://part.cl/icla), which is based on the Google CLA, and provides the Particle team a license to re-distribute your contributions.

Whenever possible, please follow these guidelines for contributions:

- Keep each pull request small and focused on a single feature or bug fix.
- Familiarize yourself with the code base, and follow the formatting principles adhered to in the surrounding code.
- Wherever possible, provide unit tests for your contributions.
- If the changes have an impact application developers, then those changes should be described in the documentation. 
- Perform a "Rebase and Merge" to complete the pull request.
