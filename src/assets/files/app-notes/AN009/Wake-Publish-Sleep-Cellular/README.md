# Simple Wake Publish Sleep (Cellular)

This example illustrates:

- Checking that the battery has sufficient capacity to connect
- Sleep on multiple connection failure to preserve battery
- Hour sleep, uses hibernate mode (`SLEEP_MODE_DEEP`)
- Use SEMI_AUTOMATIC mode
- Stay awake for firmware updates (optional)

The hibernate mode uses the lowest power, however there is a trade-off. For sleep periods less than 15 minutes, you'll use less power by using stop mode sleep (pin + time) with `SLEEP_NETWORK_STANDBY`. This is because connecting to cellular uses a significant amount of power, more than is saved by turning off the modem completely. 

Also you must not use hibernate with sleep periods of less than 10 minutes or your SIM could be blocked your mobile carrier for aggressive reconnection.

On Gen 2 devices, the power usage is around 103 µA with this example (tested with an E Series E402 and Device OS 1.5.0). In this mode, the power usage stays completely constant as the modem is turned off and the MCU is in deep sleep. 

On Gen 3 devices, this example uses stop mode sleep with cellular off, because Gen 3 devices cannot wake from hibernate mode by time.

To connect and publish:

- cloudMinTime set to 0 (no waiting for firmware updates)
- E Series E402 (LTE Cat M1)
- Device OS 1.5.0

## Finite State Machines

All of the examples use a finite state machine. While this example is simple enough you could do it with nested if statements, it's a good habit to get into using finite state machine design for your user firmware. Once your design starts to get more complicated, it can get very confusing to maintain deeply nested if statements.

![State Diagram](images/PublishStateDiagram.png)

- When the device boots, it goes into **WAIT CONNECTED** state (`STATE_WAIT_CONNECTED`). 
  - If successfully connected to the cloud, then goes into **PUBLISH** state.
  - If a timeout occurs, then goes into **SLEEP** state.

- In **PUBLISH** state, the sensor is read and the value published to the Particle cloud.
  - If it hasn't been `CLOUD_MIN_MS` milliseconds since connected to the cloud, go into **PRE SLEEP** state. This is optional.
  - Otherwise, go into **SLEEP** state.
  - This example uses a simple method of publishing that blocks the loop thread until complete. The other examples use a more advanced asynchronous mode.

- The **PRE SLEEP** state allows time for the cloud to start a product firmware update. 10 seconds is usually sufficient. If you aren't using product firmware updates, set `CLOUD_MIN_MS` to 0 and this state won't be entered.
  - This example does a firmware update check on every publish. The Stop Sleep Cellular example makes this configurable so you can do it less frequently, like once a day.

- The **SLEEP** prepares to go to sleep
  - If a firmware update has been started, goes into **FIRMWARE UPDATE** state instead.
  - Otherwise, goes into sleep mode. On wake it will start over a **START**.

- The **FIRMWARE UPDATE** waits for a firmware update to complete
  - Normally, the device will automatically reboot and apply the update and then go to **START** again.
  - If the update fails or times out, then it will go into **SLEEP** state to try again later.
 

## Configuration Parameters

There are configurable parameters near the top of the source file. This example uses [Chrono Literals](https://docs.particle.io/reference/device-os/firmware/#chrono-literals) which is a great feature of Device OS 1.5.0 and later. Instead of setting 6 minutes in milliseconds (360000 or 6 * 60 * 1000), you can just use `6min`. You can also use `30s` for seconds. Or `2h` for hours.

This is the maximum amount of time to wait for the cloud to be connected. This should be at least 5 minutes. If you set this limit shorter, on Gen 2 devices the modem may not get power cycled which may help with reconnection.

```
const std::chrono::milliseconds connectMaxTime = 6min;
```

Other parameters are listed in the comments in the source and in the code walk-through below.

## Code walk-through

In order to most effectively check the battery in setup, you need to use `SEMI_AUTOMATIC` mode.

```
#include "Particle.h"

SYSTEM_THREAD(ENABLED);
SYSTEM_MODE(SEMI_AUTOMATIC);
```

If you are testing with a developer device you should leave these lines commented out. But if you are testing product firmware updates, you'll need to uncomment these and set your own product ID and version.

```
// PRODUCT_ID(8761);
// PRODUCT_VERSION(4);
```

Using Serial1 (RX/TX) for debugging logs and an external TTL serial to USB (FT232) converter
is useful when testing sleep modes. Sleep causes USB serial to disconnect, and you will often
lose the debug logs immediately after wake. With an external USB serial converter, your
serial terminal stays connected so you get all log messages. If you don't have one, you can
comment out the Serial1LogHandler and uncomment the SerialLogHandler to use USB.

```
Serial1LogHandler logHandler(115200);
// SerialLogHandler logHandler;
```

These are our configurable parameters. This example uses [Chrono Literals](https://docs.particle.io/reference/device-os/firmware/#chrono-literals) which is a great feature of Device OS 1.5.0 and later. Instead of setting 6 minutes in milliseconds (360000 or 6 * 60 * 1000), you can just use `6min`. You can also use `30s` for seconds. Or `2h` for hours.

```
// This is the maximum amount of time to wait for the cloud to be connected.
// This should be at least 5 minutes. If you set this limit shorter,
// on Gen 2 devices the modem may not get power cycled which may help with reconnection.
const std::chrono::milliseconds connectMaxTime = 6min;

// This is the minimum amount of time to stay connected to the cloud. You can set this
// to zero and the device will sleep as fast as possible, however you may not get 
// firmware updates and device diagnostics won't go out all of the time. Setting this
// to 10 seconds is typically a good value to use for getting updates.
const std::chrono::milliseconds cloudMinTime = 10s;

// How long to sleep.
const std::chrono::seconds sleepTime = 1min;

// Maximum time to wait for publish to complete. It normally takes 20 seconds for Particle.publish
// to succeed or time out, but if cellular needs to reconnect, it could take longer, typically
// 80 seconds. This timeout should be longer than that and is just a safety net in case something
// goes wrong.
const std::chrono::milliseconds publishMaxTime = 3min;

// Maximum amount of time to wait for a user firmware download to complete
// before giving up and just going back to sleep
const std::chrono::milliseconds firmwareUpdateMaxTime = 5min;
```

Finite state machine state numbers, global variables, and some forward declarations. The forward declarations are necessary in a .cpp file when you reference the function before it's been implemented.

```
// These are the states in the finite state machine, handled in loop()
enum State {
    STATE_WAIT_CONNECTED = 0,
    STATE_PUBLISH,
    STATE_PRE_SLEEP,
    STATE_SLEEP,
    STATE_FIRMWARE_UPDATE
};
State state = STATE_WAIT_CONNECTED;
unsigned long stateTime;
bool firmwareUpdateInProgress = false;

void readSensorAndPublish(); // forward declaration
void firmwareUpdateHandler(system_event_t event, int param); // forward declaration

```

If the battery state-of-charge (SoC) is too low, a brownout can occur. On Gen 2 devices, this can cause flash sectors to be randomly erased. One way to avoid this is to do a check like this in `setup()`:

```
void setup() {
    FuelGauge fuel;
    if (fuel.getSoC() < 15) {
        // If battery is too low, don't try to connect to cellular, just go back into
        // sleep mode.
        Log.info("low battery, going to sleep immediately");
        state = STATE_SLEEP;
        return;
    }
```

In order to delay sleep while an firmware upgrade is being downloaded, we use a firmware update handler. This is registered in `setup()`.

```
    System.on(firmware_update, firmwareUpdateHandler);
```

In order to prevent connecting to cellular before the battery SoC is checked, `SEMI_AUTOMATIC` mode is used. This requires that cellular the connection be started in `setup()`.

```
    Cellular.on();
    Particle.connect();
    stateTime = millis();
}
```

The `loop()` function implements the finite state machine as a switch statement.

The first state after `setup()` is `STATE_WAIT_CONNECTED`. This waits until the cloud connects and then goes into `STATE_PUBLISH`.

If a timeout occurs, connecting takes longer than `connectMaxTime` then it transitions into `STATE_SLEEP`.

```
void loop() {
    switch(state) {
        case STATE_WAIT_CONNECTED:
            // Wait for the connection to the Particle cloud to complete
            if (Particle.connected()) {
                Log.info("connected to the cloud in %lu ms", millis() - stateTime);
                state = STATE_PUBLISH; 
                stateTime = millis(); 
            }
            else
            if (millis() - stateTime >= connectMaxTime.count()) {
                // Took too long to connect, go to sleep
                Log.info("failed to connect, going to sleep");
                state = STATE_SLEEP;
            }
            break;
```

The `STATE_PUBLISH` reads a value and publishes it. The `readSensorAndPublish()` function blocks until the publish completes. A better technique is used in the other examples like the **Stop-Sleep-Cellular** example.

If `cloudMinTime` is non-zero, then we wait for that amount of time after connecting to the cloud before going to sleep. This is to provide enough time for a software update to start. The minimum amount of time is 10 seconds. If waiting is requires, it goes into `STATE_PRE_SLEEP`.

Otherwise, it goes into `STATE_SLEEP`.

```
        case STATE_PUBLISH:
            readSensorAndPublish();

            if (millis() - stateTime < cloudMinTime.count()) {
                Log.info("waiting %lu ms before sleeping", cloudMinTime.count() - (millis() - stateTime));
                state = STATE_PRE_SLEEP;
            }
            else {
                state = STATE_SLEEP;
            }
            break;
```

The `STATE_PRE_SLEEP` waits long enough for a firmware update to start, if that feature is enabled using `cloudMinTime`.

```
        case STATE_PRE_SLEEP:
            // This delay is used to make sure firmware updates can start and diagnostics go out
            // It can be eliminated by setting cloudMinTime to 0 and sleep will occur as quickly
            // as possible. 
            if (millis() - stateTime >= cloudMinTime.count()) {
                state = STATE_SLEEP;
            }
            break;
```

The `STATE_SLEEP` first checks to see if a firmware update has started. If it has, goes into `STATE_FIRMWARE_UPDATE` state.

If not, then it goes into sleep. This state is never exited; upon wake, the device is reset and goes through `setup()` again.

```
        case STATE_SLEEP:
            if (firmwareUpdateInProgress) {
                Log.info("firmware update detected");
                state = STATE_FIRMWARE_UPDATE;
                stateTime = millis();
                break;
            }

            Log.info("going to sleep for %ld seconds", (long) sleepTime.count());
            
#if HAL_PLATFORM_NRF52840
            // Gen 3 (nRF52840) does not suppport SLEEP_MODE_DEEP with a time in seconds
            // to wake up. This code uses stop mode sleep instead. 
            System.sleep(WKP, RISING, sleepTime);
            System.reset();
#else
            System.sleep(SLEEP_MODE_DEEP, sleepTime);
            // This is never reached; when the device wakes from sleep it will start over 
            // with setup()
#endif
            break; 
```

The `STATE_FIRMWARE_UPDATE` state keeps track of when an update starts or times out. If the update completes, the device will reset by itself and start over with calling `setup()`.

```
        case STATE_FIRMWARE_UPDATE:
            if (!firmwareUpdateInProgress) {
                Log.info("firmware update completed");
                state = STATE_SLEEP;
            }
            else
            if (millis() - stateTime >= firmwareUpdateMaxTime.count()) {
                Log.info("firmware update timed out");
                state = STATE_SLEEP;
            }
            break;
    }
}
```

This example just reads the value of A0 and publishes it which isn't that useful. You'd replace this with the code for reading your sensor or whatever you're publishing.

This example does a blocking publish. The other examples use a more advanced asynchronous technique.

```
void readSensorAndPublish() {
    // This is just a placeholder for code that you're write for your actual situation
    int a0 = analogRead(A0);

    // Create a simple JSON string with the value of A0
    char buf[256];
    snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "{\"a0\":%d}", a0);

    bool result = Particle.publish("sensorTest", buf, PRIVATE | WITH_ACK);

    Log.info("published %s (result=%d)", buf, result);
}
```

The firmware update handler sets a global variable when the firmware update starts, so we can defer sleep until it completes (or times out). It may take a little while for the begin handler to be called, 10 seconds is a good minimum value.

```
void firmwareUpdateHandler(system_event_t event, int param) {
    switch(param) {
        case firmware_update_begin:
            firmwareUpdateInProgress = true;
            break;

        case firmware_update_complete:
        case firmware_update_failed:
            firmwareUpdateInProgress = false;
            break;
    }
}
```

The debugging log for a Gen 2 device will look something like this. Your log likely will not have the leftmost column.

The first part almost always looks like this. The amount of time to `Cloud: connecting` will vary depending on your cellular connection and technology. LTE Cat M1 tends to be fastest, and 2G the slowest. The part before `Cloud: connecting` is blinking green, after is blinking cyan.

Now the cloud has been connected at `Particle.connected()` will return true. We publish our example event. Since `cloudMinTime` is non-zero, we'll wait a bit before going to sleep to allow for a product firmware update to start.

In this example, since the session was resumed, we got to cloud connected state in 7.6 seconds instead of 17.5 seconds!

This example still uses the 10 second `cloudMinTime` to wait for a firmware update to start. The connection would be around 5 seconds shorter without that.
