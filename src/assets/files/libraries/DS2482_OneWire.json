  "readme": "DS2482_OneWire\n==============\n\nA OneWire library using the DS2482 I2C->1-Wire bridge. Released under GPL.\n\nThis is designed to use Dallas DS18B20 temperature sensors connected to a DS2482 I2C->1-Wire bridge as part of a temperature monitoring system.\n\nThe code heavily borrows from two sources:\n* Paeaetech's DS2482 library (https://github.com/paeaetech/paeae/tree/master/Libraries/ds2482) - the bulk of the functionality if from here, slighty changed.\n* OneWire library (http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_OneWire.html) - the CRC code is from here, along with all method names so we can use new library in place of this.\n\nDS18B20 is a 1-Wire temperature sensor (http://www.maximintegrated.com/datasheet/index.mvp/id/2812). These are commonly driven directly from an I/O pin using the OneWire library. This is fine for short and simple networks, but errors start to occur with large numbers (6+ devices) and networks longer than 5m or so.\n\nThe DS2482-100 is a I2C->1-Wire bridge (http://www.maximintegrated.com/datasheet/index.mvp/id/4382), containly functionality that means it is better at driving long and complex networks. \n\nBreakouts for the Raspberry Pi, which can be connected to Arduino, are available from Sheepwalk Electronics:\nhttp://www.sheepwalkelectronics.co.uk/product_info.php?cPath=22&products_id=30\n\n\n",
