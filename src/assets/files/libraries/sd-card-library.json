  "readme": "SparkCore-SD\n============\nWeb IDE library V0.0.1\nForked from https://github.com/technobly/SparkCore-SD by Daniel Sullivan (mumblepins)\n\nAn Implementation of the Arduino/Sparkfun SD Card Library for the Spark Core\n\nThis might be tricky to build online due to the number of files required.  I have not tried to set it up online.  Using the Spark-CLI tool might be a better way to build it online.\n\n![example](http://i.imgur.com/A3Au1B1.jpg)\n\n![example](http://i.imgur.com/aiMlHky.png)\n\n![pinout](http://i.imgur.com/JgpmcWO.png)\n\nIf you are building locally, place the files here:\n\n```cpp\n// put the entire 'libraries' folder and everything in it here\n\n..\\core-firmware\\libraries \n\n// rename one of the example apps located at ..\\libraries\\sd\\examples\\\n// to application.cpp and place it here\n\n..\\core-firmware\\src\\application.cpp\n```\nThanks to [@choosatron](http://www.choosatron.com) for your work on this!\n",
