  "readme": "# RelayShield\n\nThe RelayShield library makes it easy to use the Photon RelayShield. It provides functions to turn relays on and off, all the relays on and off at the same time, and to check whether a relay is currently on or off.\n\n## Usage\n\nPlug a Photon, Electron, or compatible device into a [Particle Relay Shield](https://store.particle.io) and you're ready to go!\n\n```\n//Create an instance of the RelayShield library, so we have something to talk to\nRelayShield myRelays;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    //.begin() sets up a couple of things and is necessary to use the rest of the functions\n    myRelays.begin();\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    // If relay 1 is on, then turn it off\n\n    if(myRelays.isOn(1)){    // myRelays.isOn(1) will return TRUE if relay 1 on and FALSE if it's off\n        myRelays.off(1);     // myRelays.off(#) will switch relay # off\n    }\n\n    // If it wasn't already on, then turn it on\n    else{\n        myRelays.on(1);      // myRelays.on(#) will switch relay # on\n    }\n\n    // Change it once a second\n    delay(1000);\n}\n```\n\n## Reference\n\n### `RelayShield`\n\n`RelayShield relays();`\n\nCreates a relay object that is used to act on the library and stores the current relay states.\n\n### `begin`\n\n`relays.begin();`\n\nSets the appropriate pins on the device to OUTPUT. D3,D4,D5,D6 are connected to the relays.\n\n### `on`\n\n`relays.on(relayNumber);`\n\nTurns the specified relay on. Valid inputs are integers 1,2,3,4.\n\n### `off`\n\n`relays.off(relayNumber);`\n\nTurns the specified relay off. Valid inputs are integers 1,2,3,4.\n\n### `allOn`\n\n`relays.allOn();`\n\nTurns all the relays on.\n\n### `allOff`\n\n`relays.allOff();`\n\nTurns all the relays off.\n\n### `isOn`\n\n`bool relayState = relays.isOn(relayNumber);`\n\nReturns `true` if a relay is currently set to on, and `false` otherwise.\n\n## Examples\n\n1. __Blink a Relay__ - Turning relays on and off, one at a time\n2. __Control all Relays__ - Turning all the relays on and off\n3. __Internet Relays__ - Setting up functions so you can call relays over the internet!\n\n## License\nCopyright 2016 Richard Whitney\n\nReleased under LGPL\n"
