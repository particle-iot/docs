  "readme": "##Forked library for Particle Photon use\n- Is confirmed to work with Particle Photon. Some updates have been made to accommodate Gen 3 devices but it has not been fully confirmed if it works, see [issues](https://community.particle.io/t/how-to-make-rfm69-work-on-photon-solved-new-library-rfm69-particle/26497/73)\n- It can be used locally or in the Particle Web IDE (it is now included in the Community Libraries to add easily)\n- A custom working [example for Photon](https://github.com/bloukingfisher/RFM69-Particle/tree/master/firmware/examples) which uses serial and Particle Console Logs for easy verification that it works.\n- If you're using ATC or Registers make sure you include these statements in Particle IDE as \"using library in app\" does not add them automatically: #include \"RFM69-Particle/RFM69_ATC.h\"  #include \"RFM69-Particle/RFM69registers.h\"\n- For ATC to function correctly make sure you use the latest library version (version 0.0.2 or later)\n\n# RFM69 Library  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LowPowerLab/RFM69.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/LowPowerLab/RFM69)\n\nBy Felix Rusu, [LowPowerLab.com](http://LowPowerLab.com)\n<br/>\nRFM69 library for RFM69W, RFM69HW, RFM69CW, RFM69HCW (semtech SX1231, SX1231H)\n<br/>\nThe latest examples, new features and bug fixes are found in the [original repository](https://github.com/LowPowerLab/RFM69) of this library.\n\n##License\nGPL 3.0, please see the [License.txt](https://github.com/LowPowerLab/RFM69/blob/master/License.txt) file for details. Be sure to include the same license with any fork or redistribution of this library.\n\n##Features\n- easy to use API with a few simple functions for basic usage\n- 255 possible nodes on 256 possible networks\n- 61 bytes max message length (limited to 61 to support AES hardware encryption)\n- customizable transmit power (32 levels) for low-power transmission control\n- sleep function for power saving\n- automatic ACKs with the sendWithRetry() function\n- hardware 128bit AES encryption\n- hardware preamble, synch recognition and CRC check\n- digital RSSI can be read at any time with readRSSI()\n- interrupt driven\n- tested on [Moteino R3, R4, R4-USB (ATMega328p), MEGA (ATMega1284p)](https://lowpowerlab.com/shop/Moteino-R4)\n- works with RFM69W, RFM69HW, RFM69CW, RFM69HCW, Semtech SX1231/SX1231H transceivers\n- promiscuous mode allows any node to listen to any packet on same network\n\n###Library Installation (Arduino IDE)\nCopy the content of this library in the \"Arduino/libraries/RFM69\" folder.\n<br />\nTo find your Arduino folder go to File>Preferences in the Arduino IDE.\n<br/>\nSee [this tutorial](http://learn.adafruit.com/arduino-tips-tricks-and-techniques/arduino-libraries) on Arduino libraries.\n\n###Hardware & programming\nThe easiest way to get started is with the well documented and supported [Moteino](http://moteino.com) microcontroller platform which is [easily programmable](https://lowpowerlab.com/programming) from the Arduino IDE. This includes the [Moteino, MoteinoUSB & MoteinoMEGA](https://lowpowerlab.com/shop/Moteino). RFM69 transceivers were extensively tested on Moteinos for the purpose of building internet of things (IoT) devices that can be controlled wirelessly. This platform has matured over time and there is now a [dedicated page](https://lowpowerlab.com/gateway) where you can review how these devices can interact with each other via a RaspberryPi gateway interface. Here's a video overview:<br/>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUUZ6k0pBHg\n<br/>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9MNZQgqKHA\n<br/>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F15dEqZ4pMM\n\n###Basic sample usage\n- The [Gateway](https://github.com/LowPowerLab/RFM69/blob/master/Examples/Gateway/Gateway.ino) example listens for incoming data from remote nodes and responds to any ACK requests\n- The [Node](https://github.com/LowPowerLab/RFM69/blob/master/Examples/Node/Node.ino) example is a loop that sends increasingly longer packets to the gateway and waits for an ACK each time\n- More examples are added from time to time, check all the [examples](https://github.com/LowPowerLab/RFM69/tree/master/Examples), visit the [LowPowerLab blog](http://lowpowerlab.com) for latest news and projects, and check out the [LowPowerLab forums](https://lowpowerlab.com/forum) for projects and discussion\n\n##Blog writeup\nSee the [library release blog post](http://lowpowerlab.com/blog/2013/06/20/rfm69-library/)\n\n##Why RFM69\n- I have spent a lot of time developing this library for RFM69W/HW transceivers. I made it open source because I believe a lot of people can benefit from this new powerful transceiver. I hope others will also contribute and build on my work\n- I have long researched alternative transceivers for RFM12B which is still an excellent transceiver but it is much lower output power and has limited built in features which need to be implemented in firmware (PREAMBLE, SYNC, CRC, packet engine, encryption etc).\n- I wanted a transceiver that could still be very small, easy to use, and have the longer range that I needed\n- RFM69 comes in 2 variants that have the same pinout layout: RFM69W (13dBm, 45mA TX) and RFM69HW (20dBm, 130mA TX). Other variants include the RFM69CW (up to 13dBm power) which is pin compatible with RFM12B, and RFM69HCW (20dBm output power).\n\n##RFM69W range and antennas\n- I have tested open-air range on these transceivers in various combinations.\n- I am happy to say that a range of upwards of 350m can be achieved with the default settings provided in the library.Some users reported upwards of 500m by lowering the bitrate, and a forum user reported 1.5miles at 1.2Kbps: see [this forum post](http://lowpowerlab.com/forum/index.php/topic,112.msg288.html) and [this blog page](http://lowpowerlab.com/moteino/#antennas)\n- The caveat with these higher RF power units is that they need more DC power when they transmit. For battery powered motes, you will need to keep them powered down and only transmit periodically. Use the sleep() function to put the radios in low power mode and use the [LowPower](https://github.com/lowpowerlab/lowpower) or [Narcoleptic](https://code.google.com/p/narcoleptic/) libraries to power down your Moteino/Arduino\n",
