  "readme": "### Isolated ISE Probe Interface\n\n> Use any Ion Specific Electrode\n- Measure pH with temperature compensation\n- Measure ORP and Eh\n- Raw mV\n- Temperature in Celsius/Fahrenheit\n- Electrically Isolated\n\n#### What it is\nAn I2C slave device that can interface with any voltage based sensor such as a pH or ORP probe. There are pin headers available to connect a DS18B20 temperature sensor for automatic temperature compensation. The firmware on the device provides two calibration options, single or dual point.\n\n#### Using it\nThere is extensive [documentation](http://ufire.co/docs/uFire_ISE/) on the use and setup of the device. The library to use it is in the Arduino IDE, Particle.io IDE and a python implementation for Raspberry Pi and MicroPython is also available.\n\n~~~\n#include \"uFire_ISE.h\"\nISE_Probe mv;\nmv.measuremV();\n~~~\n~~~\n#include \"ISE_pH.h\"\nISE_pH ph;\nph.measurepH();\n~~~\n~~~\n#include \"ISE_ORP.h\"\nISE_ORP orp;\norp.measureORP();\n~~~\n\n##### Isolation\n\nWhen different probes are connected to the same controlling device, they can cause interference. The environment also causes interference due to ground-loops or other electrical noise like pumps. Electrically isolating the probe from the controlling device can help to prevent it.\n\nAll Î¼Fire probe interfaces come with electrical isolation hardware which provides a stable, isolated power supply and I2C bus between the interface and your controlling device.",
