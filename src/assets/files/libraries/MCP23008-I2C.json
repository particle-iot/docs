  "readme": "This is very much beta, it seems to work fine but its not optimized and doesn't currently suport the interrupt capability of the chip\n\nCurrently it can do: setting pin directions, inputs and outputs and turning on/off the pull-up resistors\n\nTo use:\nConnect pin #1 of the expander to D1 (i2c clock)\nConnect pin #1 to 5V (using a pullup resistor ~4K7 (4700) ohms)\nConnect pin #2 of the expander to D0 (i2c data)\nConnect pin #2 to 5V (using a pullup resistor ~4K7 (4700) ohms)\nConnect pins #3, 4 and 5 of the expander to ground (address selection)\nConnect pin #6 and 18 of the expander to 5V (power and reset disable)\nConnect pin #9 of the expander to ground (common ground)\nPins 10 thru 17 are your input/output pins\n\nCheck the datasheet for more info: http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/21919b.pdf\n\nEnjoy and send pull requests!"
