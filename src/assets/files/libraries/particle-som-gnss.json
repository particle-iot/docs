  "readme": "# Particle SOM GNSS Library\n\nThis standalone GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) library is designed specifically for Particle cellular modems with built-in GNSS support, including the M-SOM platform.  It provides a simple and efficient interface to access and utilize GNSS data for location-based applications on Particle devices.\n\n## Note\nThis library is targeted for the M-SOM platform and can only be built with device OS version 5.8.2 and greater.\n\n## Key Features\n- Easy Integration: Seamlessly integrates with Particle devices equipped with GNSS functionality, allowing developers to quickly add location services to their IoT projects.\n- Comprehensive GNSS Data: Access essential GNSS data, including latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, and heading, directly from your Particle device.\n- Lightweight & Standalone: A lightweight library that doesn't require additional dependencies, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments.\n- User-Friendly API: Provides a straightforward API to configure, control, retrieve GNSS data, and publish to console maps interfaces with location service.\n---\n## Installation\nYou can install the library via Particle's library manager on the command line, VS Code (Workbench), or by directly cloning this repository.\n```bash\nparticle library add particle-som-gnss\n```\n\n## API\n### Configuration\n`int begin(LocationConfiguration& configuration)`\n\nThe begin function initializes and configures the Location class using the provided configuration structure.\n\nParameters\n- configuration: A LocationConfiguration structure that contains the configuration settings for the GNSS.\n\nReturns\n- int: Returns 0 on success. Any other value indicates a failure during the initialization process.\n\nDefaults\n- Passive GNSS antenna - no power applied through GNSS_ANT pin\n- GPS+GLONASS constellations\n- HDOP under 100 qualifies a fix\n- Horizontal accuracy under 50 meters qualifies a fix\n- Maximum time for fix is 90 seconds\n\n### Acquisition\n`LocationResults getLocation(LocationPoint& point, bool publish = false)`\n\nThe getLocation function retrieves the GNSS position synchronously (blocking). It blocks until the location is acquired.\n\nParameters\n- point: A LocationPoint object that will be populated with the GNSS position data.\n- publish: (Optional) If set to true, the location data will be published to the cloud after acquisition. The default value is false.\n\nReturns\n- LocationResults: An object containing the results of the location acquisition process.\n\n\n`LocationResults getLocation(LocationPoint& point, LocationDone callback, bool publish = false)`\n\nThe getLocation function retrieves the GNSS position asynchronously. It returns immediately and executes the specified callback function upon completion of the acquisition.\n\nParameters\n- point: A LocationPoint object that will be populated with the GNSS position data.\n- callback: A LocationDone callback function that is invoked once the location acquisition is complete.\n- publish: (Optional) If set to true, the location data will be published to the cloud after acquisition. The default value is false.\n\nReturns\n- LocationResults: An object containing the initial result of the location acquisition process.\n\n## Example\n\nSee examples for more examples.\n\n```cpp\nvoid setup() {\n    LocationConfiguration config;\n\n    // Identify and enable active GNSS antenna power\n    config.enableAntennaPower(GNSS_ANT_PWR);\n\n    // Assign buffer to encoder.\n    Location.begin(config);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    LocationPoint point = {};\n    // Get the current GNSS location and publish 'loc' event\n    auto results = Location.getLocation(point, true);\n    if (results == LocationResults::Fixed) {\n        Log.info(\"Position fixed\");\n    }\n```\n\n---\n\n### LICENSE\n\nUnless stated elsewhere, file headers or otherwise, all files herein are licensed under The MIT License (MIT).
