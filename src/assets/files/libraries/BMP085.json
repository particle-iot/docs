  "readme": "Grove_Barometer_Sensor\n--------------------------------\n\nThis Arduino librarry is for Grove - Barometer Sensor(BMP085) and Grove - Barometer Sensor(BMP180).\n\n<img src=https://statics3.seeedstudio.com/images/product/groveBarometer%20Sensor.jpg width=300><img src=https://statics3.seeedstudio.com/product/groveBarometer%20Sensor_01.jpg width=300>\n\n[Grove - Barometer Sensor(BMP085)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Barometer-Sensor-p-1199.html)\n\n\n<img src=https://statics3.seeedstudio.com/images/product/Grove%20Barometer%20Sensor%20BMP180.jpg width=300><img src=https://statics3.seeedstudio.com/product/Grove%20Barometer%20Sensor%20BMP180_02.jpg width=300>\n\n[Grove - Barometer Sensor(BMP180)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/s/Grove-Barometer-Sensor-(BMP180)-p-1840.html)\n\n\nThe Grove-Barometer Sensor(BMP085) features a Bosch BMP085 high-accuracy chip to detect barometric pressure and temperature. It can widely measure pressure ranging from 300hPa to 1100hPa, AKA +9000m to -500m above sea level, with a super high accuracy of 0.03hPa(0.25m) in ultra-high resolution mode.\n\nThe Grove-Barometer Sensor(BMP180) uses the Bosch BMP180 high-precision, low-power digital barometer chip. It offers a pressure measuring range of 300 to 1100 hPa with an accuracy down to 0.02 hPa in advanced resolution mode. Itâ€™s based on piezo-resistive technology for high accuracy, ruggedness and long term stability.The chip only accepts 1.8V to 3.6V input voltage. However, with outer circuit added, this module becomes compatible with 3.3V and 5V. \n\n### Usage:\n\n\tSearch and install <Grove Barometer Sensor BMP085> on Arduino Library Manager.\n\n\tOr flow the steps below.\n\n1. Clone this repo or download as a zip;\n2. Unzip the zip file if you downloaded a zip file;\n3. Copy the directory \"Grove_Barometer_Sensor\" into Arduino's libraries directory;\n4. Open Arduino IDE, go to \"File\"->\"Examples\"->\"Grove_Barometer_Sensor\"\n\nAssume that you connected the grove correctly. \n\nFor connection guide and more information, please refer to [wiki page BMP085](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Barometer_Sensor/) and [wiki page BMP180](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Barometer_Sensor-BMP180/).\n\n    \n----\n\nThis software is written by L.G. for for [Seeed Technology Inc.](http://www.seeed.cc) and is licensed under [The MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).
