  "readme": "## Grove Air Quality Sensor\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n![](https://statics3.seeedstudio.com/images/101020021%201.jpg)\n\n[Grove Air Quality Sensor](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Air-quality-sensor-p-1065.html)\n\nThis sensor is designed for comprehensive monitoring of indoor air conditions.\nIt's responsive to a wide scope of harmful gases such as carbon monoxide, alcohol, acetone, thinner, formaldehyde and so on.\nDue to the measuring mechanism, this sensor can not output specific data to describe target gases' concentrations quantitatively.\nBut it's still competent enough to be used in applications that require only qualitative results, like auto refresher sprayers and auto air cycling systems.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the [wiki page][1]\n\n----\nThis software is written by Bruce Qin for Seeed Studio<br>\nand is licensed under [The MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).
