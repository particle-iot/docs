  "readme": "# BH1750\n\n*Particle Library for the BH1750 chip*\n\nParticle library to control BH1750 chip, supports connection via any hardware I2C.\n\n## Usage\n\nConnect any BH1750 hardware, add the BH1750 library to your project and follow this simple example:\n\n```\nBH1750 sensor(0x23, Wire);\n\nvoid setup()\n{\n  sensor.begin();\n\n  sensor.set_sensor_mode(BH1750::forced_mode_high_res2);\n\n  Serial.begin();\n}\n\nvoid loop()\n{\n  sensor.make_forced_measurement();\n\n  Serial.println(String::format(\"%f\", sensor.get_light_level()));\n\n  delay(1000);\n}\n```\n\nSee the [examples](examples) folder for more details.\n\n## Contributing\n\nHere's how you can make changes to this library and eventually contribute those changes back.\n\nTo get started, [clone the library from GitHub to your local machine](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).\n\nChange the name of the library in `library.properties` to something different. You can add your name at then end.\n\nModify the sources in <src> and <examples> with the new behavior.\n\nTo compile an example, use `particle compile examples/usage` command in [Particle CLI](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/cli#update-your-device-remotely) or use our [Desktop IDE](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/dev/#compiling-code).\n\nAfter your changes are done you can upload them with `particle library upload` or `Upload` command in the IDE. This will create a private (only visible by you) library that you can use in other projects. Do `particle library add NeoRingDsp_myname` to add the library to a project on your machine or add the NeoRingDsp_myname library to a project on the Web IDE or Desktop IDE.\n\nAt this point, you can create a [GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) with your changes to the original library.\n\nIf you wish to make your library public, use `particle library publish` or `Publish` command.\n\n## LICENSE\nCopyright (C) 2014 Alik <aliktab@gmail.com> All rights reserved.\n\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
