  "readme": "# About\n\nThis Library is intended for use with NCD 4 Relay Particle Core/Photon compatible relay controllers.\n\nThe intention of this library is to make use of the NCD 4 channel relay controller with Particle development web IDE as simple as possible for users.\n###Developer information\nNCD has been designing and manufacturing computer control products since 1995.  We have specialized in hardware design and manufacturing of Relay controllers for 20 years.  We pride ourselves as being the industry leader of computer control relay products.  Our products are proven reliable and we are very excited to support Particle.  For more information on NCD please visit www.controlanything.com \n\n###Requirements\n- NCD 4 Channel Particle Core/Photon Compatible Relay board\n- Particle Core/Photon module\n- Knowledge base for developing and programming with Particle Core/Photon modules.\n\n### Version\n1.0.0\n\n### How to use this library\n\nThe libary must be imported into your application.  This can be done through the Particle WEB IDE by selecting Libraries, then select the NCD4Relay.  Click Include in App button.  Select the App you want to include the library in.  Finally click Add to this app.  For more information see [Particles's documentation] [sparkIncludeLibrary] \n\n### Example use\n\nOnce the Library is included in your application, you should see an include statement at the top like this:\n```cpp\n//This #include statement was automatically added by the Particle IDE.\n#include \"NCD4Relay/NCD4Relay.h\"\n```\nNow you need to instantiate an object of the library for use in your application like this:\n```cpp\nNCD4Relay relayController;\n```\n\nHere is an example use case for the class\n```cpp\n// This #include statement was automatically added by the Particle IDE.\n#include \"NCD4Relay/NCD4Relay.h\"\nNCD4Relay relayController;\n\nvoid setup() {\nrelayController.setAddress(0, 0, 0);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\nrelayController.turnOnAllRelays();\ndelay(500);\nrelayController.turnOffAllRelays();\ndelay(500);\nrelayController.turnOnAllRelays(1);\ndelay(500);\nrelayController.turnOnAllRelay(1);\ndelay(500);\nrelayController.turnOffAllRelay(1);\ndelay(500);\n}\n```\n\n###Public accessible methods\n```cpp\nvoid setAddress(int a0, int a1, int a2);\n```\n>Must be called first before using the object.  This method should also be called any time communication with\n>the controller is lost or broken to recover communication  This method accepts three int arguments.  This\n>tells the Library what address to direct commands to.  a0, a1, and a2 ints are representations of the three\n>jumpers on the 4 channel relay controller which are labeled on the board A0, A1, and A2.  If the jumper is\n>installed, then that int in this call should be set to 1.  If it is not installed, then the int should be set to 0. \nSo if you have A0, A1, and A2 installed, you would call ```relayController.setAddress(1, 1, 1).```\n\n\n```cpp\nvoid turnOnRelay(int Relay);\n```\n>This method accepts one int argument.  Valid int arguments 1-4.  A call to this method will turn on the\n>relay indicated by the passed int argument.\n\n\n```cpp\nvoid turnOffRelay(int Relay);\n```\n>This method accepts one int argument.  Valid int arguments 1-4.  A call to this method will turn off the relay\n>indicated by the passed int argument.\n\n\n```cpp\nvoid turnOnAllRelays();\n```\n>This method does not accept any arguments.  A call to this method will turn on all 4 relays on the\n>controller.\n\n\n```cpp\nvoid turnOffAllRelays();\n```\n>This method does not accept any arguments.  A call to this method will turn off all 4 relays on the\n>controller.\n\n\n```cpp\nvoid toggleRelay(int relay);\n```\n>This method accepts one int argument.  Valid int arguments are 1-4.  A call to this method will toggle the\n>status of the relay indicated by the passed int argument.  If the relay was previously off before the method\n>call, the relay will turn on and vice versa.\n\n\n```cpp\nvoid setBankStatus(int status);\n```\n>This method accepts one int argument.  Valid status int arguments 0-15.  A call\n>to this method will set the status of all relays on the board to the status byte passed in\nthe argument(status).  Each relay on the board (total of 4) are represented as bits in the status\n>argument.\n\n\n```cpp\nint readRelayStatus(int relay);\n```\n>This method accepts one int argument and returns one int.  Valid relay int arguments 1-4.  A call to this\n>method will read the status of the given relay passed by the relay argument and return the current on/off\n>status of the given relay.  1 will be returned if the relay is on and 0 will be returned if the relay is off. \n>256 will be returned if an error has occured (generally due to lack of communication with the controller).\n\n\n```cpp\nint readRelayBankStatus();\n```\n>This method accepts no arguments and returns one int.  A call to this\n>method will read and return the status of all relays on the board. \n>Each relay in the bank is represented as a bit in the returned int.  Valid returns are 0-15.  256 will be\n>returned if an error has occured (generally due to lack of communciation with controller).\n\n\n```cpp\nint readInputStatus(int input);\n```\n>This method accepts one int argument and returns one int.  Valid input int arguments 1-4.  A call to this\n>method will read the status of the given input passed by the input argument and return the current closed/open\n>status of the given input.  1 will be returned if the input is closed and 0 will be returned if the input is open.\n>256 will be returned if an error has occured(generally due to lack of communication with the controller).\n\n\n```cpp\nbyte readAllInputs();\n```\n>This method accepts no arguments and returns one byte.  A call to this\n>method will read and return the status of all 4 inputs on the board. \n>Each input on the board is represented as a bit in the returned byte.  Valid returns are 0-15.  If the input is closed \n>the bit in the byte is set to 1, if the input is open the bit in the byte is set to 0.  256 will be\n>returned if an error has occured (generally due to lack of communciation with controller).\n\n\n###Public accessible variables\n```cpp\nbool initialized;\n```\n>This boolean indicates the current status of the interface connection to the controller.  This variable should\n>be checked often throughout your application.  If communication to the board is lost for any reason this\n>boolean variable will return false.  If all is well, it will return true.\n\n\nLicense\n----\n\nGNU\n[sparkIncludeLibrary]:http://docs.spark.io/build/#flash-apps-with-spark-build-using-libraries\n",
