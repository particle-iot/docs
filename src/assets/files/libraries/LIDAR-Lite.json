Additionally, it can provide a user of any\nplatform with a template for their own application code.\n\nFor detailed specifications, pinout, and connection diagrams, see the manuals linked at the above product pages.\n\n***A Note on Compatibility:*** *Minor interface changes have occurred between LIDAR-Lite v3, v3HP, and previous versions. Backwards-compatibility of this library is largely preserved, though support is not directly provided for v1 and v2.*\n\n## Installation instructions\nTo install, download this repository and place in your Arduino libraries folder or use the Arduino Library Manager. If you need help, follow the instructions here: [http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries).\n\n## Example Sketches\n### v3/GetDistancePWM\nThis is the simplest demonstration of LIDAR-Lite. It shows how to read a distance using the PWM interface.\n\n### v3/GetDistanceI2c\nThis demonstration shows how to read distance using the I2C interface and choose preset configurations.\n\n### v3/ShortRangeHighSpeed\nThis example shows a method to run LIDAR-Lite at high speed for short range applications. It combines a variety of settings to trade off range and accuracy for very fast measurements.\n\n### v3HP/v3HP_I2C\nThis example shows various methods to run LIDAR-Lite v3HP.\n\n### v3HP/v3HP_MONITOR\nUse the MODE pin to monitor STATUS of the LIDAR-Lite v3HP.\n\n### v4LED/v4LED_I2C/\nOperation examples for LIDAR-Lite v4 LED.\n\n## Version History\n* [3.0.1](https://github.com/garmin/LIDARLite_Arduino_Library/tree/3.0.1) - v4 LED example clean up and library fixes\n* [3.0.0](https://github.com/garmin/LIDARLite_Arduino_Library/tree/3.0.0) - Support for LIDAR-Lite v4 LED\n* [2.0.6](https://github.com/garmin/LIDARLite_Arduino_Library/tree/2.0.6) - Add v3HP library function to reset the reference filter\n* [2.0.5](https://github.com/garmin/LIDARLite_Arduino_Library/tree/2.0.5) - Add v3 library function to set alternate I2C addr\n* [2.0.4](https://github.com/garmin/LIDARLite_Arduino_Library/tree/2.0.4) - Update short-range, high-error configuration\n* [2.0.3](https://github.com/garmin/LIDARLite_Arduino_Library/tree/2.0.3) - New example using MODE pin for STATUS output of v3HP\n* [2.0.2](https://github.com/garmin/LIDARLite_Arduino_Library/tree/2.0.2) - Updates to v3HP library\n* [2.0.0](https://github.com/garmin/LIDARLite_Arduino_Library/tree/2.0.0) - Support for LIDAR-Lite v3HP\n* [1.0.3](https://github.com/garmin/LIDARLite_Arduino_Library/tree/1.0.3) - Fix version convention\n* [1.0.2](https://github.com/garmin/LIDARLite_Arduino_Library/tree/v1.0.2) - Library Manager Update\n* [1.0.1](https://github.com/garmin/LIDARLite_Arduino_Library/tree/v1.0.1) - Release to Library Manager\n* [1.0.0](https://github.com/garmin/LIDARLite_Arduino_Library/tree/1.0.0) - Initial release\n\n## Raspberry Pi Library for LIDAR-Lite v3\n* [LIDAR-Lite v3 on Pi](https://github.com/garmin/LIDARLite_RaspberryPi_Library/) - Basic support available for Raspberry Pi 3B+\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2018 Garmin Ltd. or its subsidiaries.
