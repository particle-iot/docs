  "readme": "# soundtouch\n\nA Particle library for basic control of Bose Soundtouch speakers.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Have a Soundtouch speaker on your network\n\n2. Have a Particle device on your network\n\n3. Run a project using this library on your Particle device\n\n4. Observe that this library discovers your Soundtouch speaker\n\n5. Observe thsat this library doesn't do much useful to control it yet\n\n6. Send a pull request implementing the thing you want to do\n\nSee the [examples](examples) folder for more details.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe major API is the Speaker class.  Currently the best way to obtain a Speaker class is to either use the Soundtouch class to discover one, or to instantiate directly with an IP address.\n\n## Contributing\n\nHere's how you can make changes to this library and eventually contribute those changes back.\n\nTo get started, [clone the library from GitHub to your local machine](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).\n\nChange the name of the library in `library.properties` to something different. You can add your name at then end.\n\nModify the sources in <src> and <examples> with the new behavior.\n\nTo compile an example, use `particle compile examples/usage` command in [Particle CLI](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/cli#update-your-device-remotely) or use our [Desktop IDE](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/dev/#compiling-code).\n\nAfter your changes are done you can upload them with `particle library upload` or `Upload` command in the IDE. This will create a private (only visible by you) library that you can use in other projects. Do `particle library add soundtouch_myname` to add the library to a project on your machine or add the soundtouch_myname library to a project on the Web IDE or Desktop IDE.\n\nAt this point, you can create a [GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) with your changes to the original library. \n\nIf you wish to make your library public, use `particle library publish` or `Publish` command.\n\n## LICENSE\nCopyright 2017 Matt Bornski\n\nLicensed under the MIT license\n",
