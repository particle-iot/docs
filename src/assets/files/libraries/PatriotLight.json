  "readme": "# PatriotLight\n\nA Patriot plugin to support dimmable light devices.\n\nThis library makes it used to support dimmable lights using PWM,\nor simple on/off lights if connected to a non-PWM pin.\n\n## Usage\n\nInclude this library in any Photon sketch that needs to support a light.\nRefer to the included example sketch, or to the more complex examples\nin the main Patriot IoT examples directory.\n\nThe example below creates a single LED device connected to pin D7 named \"blue\".\nThis is the pin used by the onboard blue LED, so no additional\nhardware is needed.\n\nAn additional behavior is setup to control this LED with an event named \"Photon\".\n\nAlso, a switch connected to the D0 pin is used to control the LED locally.\n\nSince Patriot supports automatic detection by the iOS app and Alexa,\neither of these can be used to control the LED once this sketch is\nloaded to a Photon. There may be a 15 minute delay before Alexa starts\nto work, since a \"Discover Devices\" cycle is needed. You can manually\ninvoke a discovery using the Alexa app to eliminate the delay.\n\n\n```\n#include <IoT.h>\n#include <PatriotLight.h>\n\nIoT *iot;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    iot = IoT::getInstance();\n    iot->begin();\n\n    Light *light1 = new Light(kLed1Pin, \"blue\", false, true);\n    light1->setLocalPin(D0, \"Switch\");\n    iot->addDevice(light1);\n\n    iot->addBehavior(light1, new Behavior(\"Photon\", '>', 0, 100));\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    iot->loop();\n}\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nRefer to the Patriot Github repository and documentation for more\ninformation.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nHere's how you can make changes to this library and eventually contribute those changes back.\n\nTo get started, [clone the library from GitHub to your local machine](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).\n\nChange the name of the library in `library.properties` to something different. You can add your name at then end.\n\nModify the sources in <src> and <examples> with the new behavior.\n\nTo compile an example, use `particle compile examples/usage` command in [Particle CLI](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/cli#update-your-device-remotely) or use our [Desktop IDE](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/dev/#compiling-code).\n\nAfter your changes are done you can upload them with `particle library upload` or `Upload` command in the IDE. This will create a private (only visible by you) library that you can use in other projects. Do `particle library add IoT_myname` to add the library to a project on your machine or add the IoT_myname library to a project on the Web IDE or Desktop IDE.\n\nAt this point, you can create a [GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) with your changes to the original library.\n\nIf you wish to make your library public, use `particle library publish` or `Publish` command.\n\n## LICENSE\nCopyright 2017-2019 Ron Lisle\n\nRefer to the included LICENSE file.\n",
