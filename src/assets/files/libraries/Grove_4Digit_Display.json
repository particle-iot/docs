  "readme": "Grove_4Digital_Display\n--------------------------------\n\n![Grove_4Digital_Display](https://statics3.seeedstudio.com/images/product/4-Digital%20Display.jpg)\n\n[Grove - 4-Digit Display](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-4-Digit-Display-p-1198.html)\n\n4 digit display module is usually a 12 pin module. In this Grove gadget, we utilize a TM1637 to scale down the controlling pins into 2 Grove pins. It only takes 2 digital pins of Arduino or Seeeduino to control the content, even the luminance of this display. For projects that require of alpha-numeric display, this can be a nice choice.\n\n***Library Requirement***\n\nInstall libraries on Arduino Library Mnager.\n\n\tTimerOne - maintained by Paul Stoffregen\n\n\nFor connection guide and more information, please refer to [wiki page](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-4-Digit_Display/).\n\n    \n----\n\nThis software is written by Frankie.Chu for for [Seeed Technology Inc.](http://www.seeed.cc) and is licensed under [The MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).
