  "readme": "# UIPEthernet\r\n\r\nA Particle project named UIPEthernet\r\n\r\n## Welcome to your project!\r\n\r\nEvery new Particle project is composed of 3 important elements that you'll see have been created in your project directory for UIPEthernet.\r\n\r\n#### ```/src``` folder:  \r\nThis is the source folder that contains the firmware files for your project. It should *not* be renamed. \r\nAnything that is in this folder when you compile your project will be sent to our compile service and compiled into a firmware binary for the Particle device that you have targeted.\r\n\r\nIf your application contains multiple files, they should all be included in the `src` folder. If your firmware depends on Particle libraries, those dependencies are specified in the `project.properties` file referenced below.\r\n\r\n#### ```.ino``` file:\r\nThis file is the firmware that will run as the primary application on your Particle device. It contains a `setup()` and `loop()` function, and can be written in Wiring or C/C++. For more information about using the Particle firmware API to create firmware for your Particle device, refer to the [Firmware Reference](https://docs.particle.io/reference/firmware/) section of the Particle documentation.\r\n\r\n#### ```project.properties``` file:  \r\nThis is the file that specifies the name and version number of the libraries that your project depends on. Dependencies are added automatically to your `project.properties` file when you add a library to a project using the `particle library add` command in the CLI or add a library in the Desktop IDE.\r\n\r\n## Adding additional files to your project\r\n\r\n#### Projects with multiple sources\r\nIf you would like add additional files to your application, they should be added to the `/src` folder. All files in the `/src` folder will be sent to the Particle Cloud to produce a compiled binary.\r\n\r\n#### Projects with external libraries\r\nIf your project includes a library that has not been registered in the Particle libraries system, you should create a new folder named `/lib/<libraryname>/src` under `/<project dir>` and add the `.h` and `.cpp` files for your library there. All contents of the `/lib` folder and subfolders will also be sent to the Cloud for compilation.\r\n\r\n## Compiling your project\r\n\r\nWhen you're ready to compile your project, make sure you have the correct Particle device target selected and run `particle compile <platform>` in the CLI or click the Compile button in the Desktop IDE. The following files in your project folder will be sent to the compile service:\r\n\r\n- Everything in the `/src` folder, including your `.ino` application file\r\n- The `project.properties` file for your project\r\n- Any libraries stored under `lib/<libraryname>/src`",
