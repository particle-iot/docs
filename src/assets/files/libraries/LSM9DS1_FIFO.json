  "readme": "# LSM9DS1_FIFO\n\nThis library is a fork of the Adafruit_LSM9DS1 library, with changes made to enable FIFO accelerometer support on the LSM9DS1 at a 119Hz sample rate.\n\n---\n\nThis is a library for the Adafruit triple-axis accelerometer/magnetometer/gyroscope LSM9DS1  breakouts\n\nDesigned specifically to work with the Adafruit LSM9DS1 Breakout\n\n   *  https://www.adafruit.com/products/3387\n\nThese sensors use I2C to communicate, 2 pins are required to interface\nAdafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code, \nplease support Adafruit and open-source hardware by purchasing \nproducts from Adafruit!\n\nCheck out the links above for our tutorials and wiring diagrams \n\nWritten by Kevin Townsend for Adafruit Industries.
