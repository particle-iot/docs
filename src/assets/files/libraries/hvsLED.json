  "readme": "# hvsLED\r\n\r\nA Particle library for LED\r\n\r\n## Welcome to your library!\r\n\r\nTo get started, modify the sources in src. Rename the example folder inside examples to a more meaningful name and add additional examples in separate folders.\r\n\r\nTo compile your example you can use `particle compile examples/usage` command in [Particle CLI](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/cli#update-your-device-remotely) or use our [Desktop IDE](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/dev/#compiling-code).\r\n\r\nLibraries can also depend on other libraries. To add a dependency use [`particle library add`](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/cli#adding-a-library) or [library management](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/dev/#managing-libraries) in Desktop IDE.\r\n\r\nAfter the library is done you can upload it with `particle library upload` or `Upload` command in the IDE. This will create a private (only visible by you) library that you can use in other projects. If you wish to make your library public, use `particle library publish` or `Publish` command.\r\n\r\n_TODO: update this README_\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nConnect XYZ hardware, add the Variables library to your project and follow this simple example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include \"Variables.h\"\r\nVariables variables;\r\n\r\nvoid setup() {\r\n  variables.begin();\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid loop() {\r\n  variables.process();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the examples folder for more details.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nTODO: Describe `Variables`\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nHere's how you can make changes to this library and eventually contribute those changes back.\r\n\r\nTo get started, [clone the library from GitHub to your local machine](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).\r\n\r\nChange the name of the library in `library.properties` to something different. You can add your name at then end.\r\n\r\nModify the sources in <src> and <examples> with the new behavior.\r\n\r\nTo compile an example, use `particle compile examples/usage` command in [Particle CLI](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/cli#update-your-device-remotely) or use our [Desktop IDE](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/dev/#compiling-code).\r\n\r\nAfter your changes are done you can upload them with `particle library upload` or `Upload` command in the IDE. This will create a private (only visible by you) library that you can use in other projects. Do `particle library add Variables_myname` to add the library to a project on your machine or add the Variables_myname library to a project on the Web IDE or Desktop IDE.\r\n\r\nAt this point, you can create a [GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) with your changes to the original library. \r\n\r\nIf you wish to make your library public, use `particle library publish` or `Publish` command.\r\n\r\n## LICENSE\r\nCopyright 2018 Matt Allan\r\n\r\nLicensed under the <insert your choice of license here> license\r\n",
