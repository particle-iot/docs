All credit goes to the\npeople at SparkFun.\n===========================================================\n\n![SparkFun GPS-RTK - NEO-M8P-2](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/parts/1/3/2/8/2/14980-Ublox_GPS-RTK__Qwiic__-_NEO-M8P-2-01.jpg)\n\n[*SparkFun GPS-RTK - NEO-M8P-2 (SPX-14980)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14980)\n\nThe NEO-M8P-2 module is the top-of-the-line module for high accuracy GNSS and GPS location solutions including RTK. The NEO-M8P-2 is unique in that it is capable of both rover and base station operations. The ‘-2’ designation means this module has survey-in mode allowing the module to become a base station and produce RTCM 3.x correction data. \n\nThis library allows the reading of NMEA data over I2C as well as sending binary UBX configuration commands over I2C. This is helpful for configuring advanced modules like the NEO-M8P-2.\n\nRepository Contents\n-------------------\n\n* **/examples** - Example sketches for the library (.ino). Run these from the Arduino IDE. \n* **/src** - Source files for the library (.cpp, .h).\n* **keywords.txt** - Keywords from this library that will be highlighted in the Arduino IDE. \n* **library.properties** - General library properties for the Arduino package manager. \n\nDocumentation\n--------------\n\n* **[Installing an Arduino Library Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library)** - Basic information on how to install an Arduino library.\n* **[Product Repository](https://github.com/sparkfunX/Qwiic_GPS-RTK)** - Main repository (including hardware files)\n\nLicense Information\n-------------------\n\nThis product is _**open source**_! \n\nVarious bits of the code have different licenses applied.
