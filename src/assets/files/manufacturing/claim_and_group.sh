# This script does the following:
# 1. Create a log file of batch actions
# 2. Create the group name in the product, if it exists note in the log and continue
# 3. For each device ID in the file:
#    a. Claim to email
#    b. Add to the product
#    c. Add to group
#
# INPUT
# File with one device ID per line. This script extracts the device ID from the first 24 characters of the line.
#
# OUTPUT
# log_claim_and_group_<groupName>_<productID>.txt file with a list of success/fail of claim and group for each device ID.
#
# Example:
# ./claim_and_group.sh group_name_noSpaces <access_token> <productID> filename_deviceIDs.csv

# If the results file exists, remove it
filename="log_claim_and_group_$1_$3.txt";
if [[ -f "$filename" ]]
then
    rm "$filename";
