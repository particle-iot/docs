// We define MY_LED to be the LED that we want to blink.

// In this tutorial, we're using the blue D7 LED (next to D7 on the Photon
// and Electron, and next to the USB connector on the Argon and Boron).
const pin_t MY_LED = D7;

// The following line is optional, but recommended in most firmware. It
// allows your code to run before the cloud is connected. In this case,
// it will begin blinking almost immediately instead of waiting until
// breathing cyan,

// The setup() method is called once when the device boots.
void setup()

	// In order to set a pin, you must tell Device OS that the pin is
	// an OUTPUT pin. This is often done from setup() since you only need
	// to do it once.
	pinMode(MY_LED, OUTPUT);

// The loop() method is called frequently.
void loop()
{
	// Turn on the LED
	digitalWrite(MY_LED, HIGH);

	// Leave it on for one second
	delay(1s);

	// Turn it off
	digitalWrite(MY_LED, LOW);

	delay(1s);

	// And repeat!
