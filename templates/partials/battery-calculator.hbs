            using an external power supply. Other modes can be used with custom firmware, but are not recommended for 
            the Tracker One and Tracker SoM.</p>

        <p>We do not recommend using the battery until completely discharged. While LiPo batteries are not damaged by complete discharge, during
            the connection to cellular the device will use a lot of current, which can cause the MCU to brown out and reset. This 
            should be avoided because abruptly resetting the cellular modem can damage it, particularly with the 
            [SARA R410M](/reference/technical-advisory-notices/tan004-power-off-recommendations-for-sara-r410m-equipped-devices/) cellular modem.
