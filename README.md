## Particle Documentation [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spark/docs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spark/docs)
=======

Here you'll find the documentation for the Particle platform, including the Particle Cloud, Photon, and Spark Core.

To view this documentation, visit [our website](http://docs.particle.io), where the documentation is hosted.

**Note**: This is a new public repository as of May 18, 2015. All
outstanding pull requests from the old docs repository have been closed.
Please re-open them in this repo.

### Installation

To host this documentation locally, you'll need Node.js and npm:

    brew install nodejs

Once you have Node.js set up, navigate to this repository's directory on your machine, and then:

    npm install

to install any other necessary dependencies.

### Hosting locally

This documentation uses a fabulous tool from the folks at Segment called [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io). Metalsmith is a static site generator that builds static HTML sites from source material in other formats; in this case, Markdown and Handlebars.

To run a locally hosted version of the documentation, follow the installation instructions above, and then within the 'docs' directory type in your terminal:

`npm start`

This will set up a server running at `http://localhost:8080`. If you make changes to the source content, your browser should automatically refresh using `livereload`.

### Testing

To run the tests locally, run `npm test` from the root of the
repository. This will tell you whether the build will pass on Travis or
not.

### Deployment

When updated documentation is pushed to the master branch, it is automatically pushed to Amazon S3 by Travis CI.

### Organization

The majority of the content herein is stored in the `src/content/en` directory as a set of Markdown files. Assets such as images and javascript are stored in the `src/assets` directory.

Within the `en` subdirectory, there are three subfolders: `core`,
`photon`, and `shared`. Files in `core` will only be shown in the menu when the user
is viewing Core-specific docs, and `photon` files will be visible when
viewing Photon-specific docs. Files in `shared` will be nested under both
devices, so put pages here that apply to both the Core and the Photon.

If you create a new file under the `shared`, please add `shared: true`
to the front-matter at the beginning of the MD file so that the link to
edit the file on GitHub will be correct. For instance:

```
---
word: API
title: Cloud code (API)
order: 4
shared: true
---
```

### Structuring your content

The docs dynamically generate a table of contents for navigation purposes based on the headers (i.e. `###`) that you use on each page. It is important to note that _order and heirarchy matters_ when you are designing the organization of content on your page. Your page should include the following:

* 1 `h1` at the top of the page that will serve as the title of the page. You can even copy the `title` directly from the front-matter of the markdown file like this: `# {{title}}`

* As many `h2`s (`##`) as you'd like to serve as the section headers for the page.

* Underneath every `h2`, if applicable, as many `h3`s (`###`) as you'd like to serve as sub-sections within the section. These will appear as nested within the navigation on the left.

Note that there are only 2 levels of navigation that will appear in the table of contents. *`h4`s and below will not appear in the table of contents*.

### Device Specific Content

If you are working on a page that has device-specific content, the
first thing you need to do is add the relevant device names to the
front-matter of the MD file, like this:

```
devices: [ photon, electron, core ]
```
Where Photon, Electron and Core are the relevant devices to this page.

Then add a new key to `device_features.json` for each device that
supports the feature:
```
{
  "Core": [
    ...
  ],
  "Photon": [
    ..
    "backup-ram"
  ],
  "Electron": [
    ...
    "backup-ram"
  ]
}
```

Then, in the body of the page, you can specify feature-specific content by using:
```
{{#if has-backup-ram}}
## Backup RAM

...
{{/if}} {{!-- has-backup-ram --}}
```

For content that is exclusively for one device and where defining a new
feature name doesn't make sense (for example, which pins have PWM
support for a device), you can also device-specific content by using:

```
{{#if photon}}
  PHOTON SPECIFIC STUFFZ
{{/if}}

{{#if core}}
  CORE SPECIFIC STUFFZ
{{/if}}

{{#if electron}}
  ELECTRON SPECIFIC STUFFZ
{{/if}}
```
Prefer defining new feature names over using device-specific sections.

You can also insert the selected device name into text like this:
```
Without a doubt, the {{device}} rocks!
```

### Tests

To run the test scripts, run `npm test`.

### Adding a new device

When the firmware is available on a new device, add that device to the docs in these places:

- Make the firmware docs available for the new device by adding an entry to the `devices` frontmatter in <src/content/reference/firmware.md>
- Also update `devices` in the guides and tools frontmatter as appropriate
- Update the device selection dropdown in <templates/partials/header.hbs>
- Add the device in <src/assets/js> `rememberDevices()`
- Add a new SVG in <src/assets/image> named `<device>.svg`
- Tell the tests to crawl the new device page in <test/crawler.js>

### Attributions

Some of this documentation is derived from the [Arduino documentation](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference), as the Arduino/Wiring language and libraries are used extensively on the Spark Core.

This documentation was originally built using [Flatdoc](http://ricostacruz.com/flatdoc/), an awesome tool for building beautiful documentation from simple Markdown files. We have made many modifications since, but the inspiration remains.

### Contributions

This documentation is managed by Particle, but supported by the community. We welcome contributions such as:

* Edits to improve grammar or fix typos
* Edits to improve clarity
* Additional annotated examples for others to follow
* Additional content that would help provide a complete understanding of the Particle platform
* Translations to other languages

Making a contribution is as simple as forking this repository, making edits to your fork, and contributing those edits as a pull request. For more information on how to make a pull request, see [Github's documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
